# Service-level objectives

## Availability SLI

Measure each critical journey separately so a high-volume healthy endpoint
cannot hide a broken low-volume endpoint:

1. authenticate and refresh identity;
2. connect an agent and publish a Relaycast message;
3. deliver that message to an online recipient;
4. accept a session ingest request durably;
5. read and search an authorized session through RelayHistory;
6. load the dashboard and complete a control API request.

An eligible operation is a production request or synthetic attempt for one of
these journeys. Exclude health probes, operator/admin traffic, load-test
traffic, and requests rejected before application processing because they are
malformed or unauthorized. Count service-generated `408`, `429`, and every
`5xx`, timeout, reset, failed WebSocket handshake, duplicate visible delivery,
or missing delivery as bad. Customer-caused `4xx` responses other than `408`
and `429` are excluded. Publish and ingest are good only after the service has
reached the durability point promised by its API.

For journey \(j\):

`availability_j = good eligible operations_j / all eligible operations_j`

Every journey and the aggregate of all journeys must be at least 99.9% over
each calendar month. Missing telemetry is bad data for release approval; it
must not be silently excluded.

A ratio over too few operations is not evidence: 0/0 is undefined and 1/1 says
nothing about 99.9%. Before the evaluation window starts, predeclare a minimum
eligible-operation count per journey per window, and run synthetic probes at a
rate that meets it even without production traffic. For a 99.9% objective the
minimum should be at least 1,000 eligible operations per journey per window, so
that a single bad operation is visible as a budget burn. A journey with zero or
fewer than the predeclared minimum eligible operations fails the release gate;
it is not counted as meeting the objective. The same minimum applies to each
latency percentile in the table below: report the sample count, and treat a
percentile computed from fewer samples than predeclared as a failed gate.

The monthly error budget is:

`budget_j = 0.001 * all eligible operations_j`

Budget consumption is:

`burn_j = bad eligible operations_j / budget_j`

No release may use unused budget from another journey or another month.
Planned maintenance consumes the budget because it affects the customer.

## Latency and ingest-lag release gates

The following are acceptance thresholds, not measured benchmark results.
Measure at the service edge, report p50/p95/p99 and sample count, and evaluate
each critical journey independently during the supported-tier load test.

| SLI | p95 gate | p99 gate | Measurement |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Relaycast publish acknowledgement | 250 ms | 1 s | request accepted to durable acknowledgement |
| Online message delivery | 1 s | 5 s | publish accepted to recipient event received |
| Identity/control API | 500 ms | 2 s | edge receive to complete response |
| Session ingest acceptance | 500 ms | 2 s | edge receive to durable acceptance |
| RelayHistory authorized read/search | 1 s | 3 s | edge receive to complete response |
| Dashboard initial HTML | 1 s | 2 s | edge receive to complete HTML response |
| Session searchable lag | 60 s | 300 s | ingest acceptance to authorized search visibility |

In addition, no accepted session may remain unsearchable for more than 15
minutes during a passing test. The test must distinguish queueing lag from
clock skew and must use synchronized clocks.

## Recovery objectives

- **RPO:** at most 15 minutes, measured per store with durable watermarks.
  Before injecting the fault, record a server-side durable watermark for each
  store, taken from that store's own committed state rather than client
  clocks: for each PostgreSQL database, the commit timestamp and identifier of
  the newest committed row in a designated canary table (or the current WAL
  LSN with its commit time); for Relaycast and RelayAuth, the newest committed
  canary row in each SQLite database; for object storage, the newest canary
  object and its server-side creation time. Write canaries to every store at a
  fixed interval no longer than one minute throughout the drill. After the
  restore, read each store's restored watermark the same way. The per-store gap
  is the pre-fault watermark minus the restored watermark, and the RPO result
  is the largest per-store gap. It must be no more than 15 minutes. Do not
  compare timestamps across stores, because their clocks and commit points are
  independent.
- **RTO:** at most 4 hours. Start the timer when the incident commander
  declares restore required. Stop only after all critical-journey probes pass
  continuously for 15 minutes and data consistency checks complete.

A backup job completing is not RPO evidence, and a pod becoming Ready is not
RTO evidence.

# Self-hosted customer image and source inventory

Status: every image in the gated GCP profile (`values-gcp.yaml`) is approved
(agent-relay 0.3.12, audited 2026-11-04). The six optional durable-actors
images below are public but not approved; they are outside the gated profile. The customer release gate stays blocked on the non-image items
in [`docs/handoff/STATUS.md`](handoff/STATUS.md).

The machine-readable source of this audit is
[`self-hosted/customer-images.yaml`](../self-hosted/customer-images.yaml); this
page summarizes it, and the manifest wins if they ever disagree. Recorded
digests are evidence, not approvals. The GCP proof Artifact Registry
repository is not a customer distribution contract. Separate chart-bundle
licensing and notice gaps are recorded in
[`THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`](../THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md); resolving an image row
does not resolve those packaging blockers.

## Scope and method

This inventory covers the full-customer GCP umbrella profile in
`charts/agent-relay/values-gcp.yaml`, with all six product components
enabled. It produces seven unique images because the Sessions migration Job
also runs a CloudNativePG PostgreSQL wait-for-role init container.

`values-gcp.yaml` pins all seven by digest, and every one is public on GHCR
(anonymous pull verified for both platforms).

Images disabled by this profile are not active: MinIO (`locker.enabled=false`),
the OpenTelemetry collector (`otel.enabled=false`), the HoopDb Cluster, and
`alpine/k8s` for the three disabled privileged SQL Jobs. Durable actors,
Relayfile and Relayflows are optional components, off in this profile, and are
not part of this matrix.

The audit checked:

- chart values and rendered Deployment/Job container images;
- source repository, exact commit, and license;
- the release workflow and run that built each digest;
- registry manifests for platform coverage;
- SBOM and provenance attestations, and signatures where published.

`relay-dashboard` intentionally appears twice in the rendered Pod (an init
container copies static assets into a writable volume and the application
container serves them), but it is one unique image. Product migration Jobs
reuse their component image rather than adding another image.

## Optional durable-actors images (agent-relay 0.3.12)

`values-eks-actors.yaml` (durable actors on AWS EKS, off by default) pins six
more images. All six are public on GHCR: an anonymous token, the image index
and every platform manifest returned 200 on 2026-11-04. They are recorded in
`self-hosted/customer-images.yaml` as inactive entries, because the gated GCP
profile keeps durable actors off. They have no customer license or release
approval yet; approve them before they join a gated profile.

The header comment of `values-eks-actors.yaml` still says these packages may
be private and need mirroring. It is out of date: they are public. Mirror them
by digest anyway, like every other image. The comment is corrected with the
next chart version bump, because chart files cannot change without one.

The relaycast-actors-gateway image has no OCI revision or license label, and
the deployer's labels read revision `38afee6c` and licenses `NOASSERTION`
(inherited). The table records the publish run's head revision instead.

## Customer acquisition and promotion

An image may enter customer values only after all of these gates pass:

1. Record an exact committed source revision and the Dockerfile/build context.
2. Approve source and binary distribution terms.
3. Build that revision in a reviewed workflow for every required Linux
   architecture. Emit and retain the digest, SBOM, provenance, vulnerability
   review, and workflow run.
4. Record product compatibility and support approval against that digest.
5. Publish to an approved public vendor repository or establish a documented
   customer entitlement. The proof Artifact Registry repository is not valid.
6. Copy `SOURCE@sha256:...` into the customer-owned registry by digest. Resolve
   and record the destination digest; do not assume cross-registry copies
   preserve it.
7. From the customer environment, verify pull authorization, platform
   manifests, signatures/provenance, SBOM, scan result, and runtime
   compatibility.
8. Set only the customer repository and immutable destination digest in the
   customer's values. Render and reject any proof registry, vendor-private
   package without entitlement, mutable tag, all-zero sentinel, or empty
   digest.

No one should retag a proof image and call that promotion. A customer release
must be rebuilt from reviewed committed source, except for an explicitly
approved byte-for-byte third-party mirror.

## Exact blockers

None for the gated profile's images. The optional durable-actors images still
need a license and release approval before they join a gated profile. `IMG-BLOCK-001` and `IMG-BLOCK-005` (Sessions services),
`IMG-BLOCK-002` (RelayHistory) and `IMG-BLOCK-003` (control API) were closed
in agent-relay 0.3.11: each release image is public on GHCR, built by a
reviewed workflow from a recorded `main` revision with an SBOM and max-mode
provenance, and both platforms were verified anonymously. Relaycast was
closed in agent-relay 0.3.3 by the attested 12.7.0 digest.

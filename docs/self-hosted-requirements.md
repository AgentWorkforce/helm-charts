# Self-hosted requirements and options

Everything a self-hosted Agent Relay operator has to provide or decide, per
install profile, generated from one registry. A **requirement** must exist
before install (a Kubernetes Secret with exact keys, a database role or
extension, a DNS name and certificate, workload identity, a cluster
capability). An **option** is a choice with a default (database backend and
mode, function boundary, ingress scheme, add-ons). Each entry says which chart
values, env vars and Secret keys it maps to, who provides it in each profile,
and how to verify it. CI keeps the registry, the charts and this page in step:
every env var, Secret key and Secret-bearing value the templates use must be
registered, every shipped entry must exist in the charts, planned entries must
not be referenced by any template, and the compatibility matrix must equal
the pinned digests.

Source of truth: [`self-hosted/requirements.yaml`](../self-hosted/requirements.yaml). 103 entries: 39 requirements (38 shipped, 1 planned), 64 options (62 shipped, 2 planned).

Leaf chart defaults are unchanged. Supersedes the never-tagged 0.3.10 and includes its changes: values-eks.yaml, the AWS EKS profile proven end to end on EKS Auto Mode with real DNS and TLS and the interim bearer off (docs/self-hosted-eks.md): one ALB Ingress with host rules and an ACM certificate (scripts/selfhost/eks-alb-ingress.sh), EKS Pod Identity to S3 for the Sessions Pipeline, in-cluster CloudNativePG for HoopDb, the control API and RelayHistory, Relaycast on SQLite, RelayHistory ghcr.io/agentworkforce/relayhistory@sha256:d3166bb1 (relayhistory-cloud 53c3333) and the services image 96bulls-services@sha256:070fe6fd (sessions-pipeline f1c2672, with #204). 0.3.10 in turn supersedes the never-tagged 0.3.9 and includes its changes: Bundles relay-cloud-api 0.2.4: first-boot bootstrap (bootstrap.orgName/adminEmail create the organization, its owner and a Default workspace bound to a new Relaycast workspace through secretKeys.relaycastInternalSecret; idempotent), sign-in (auth.oidc OpenID Connect with PKCE; auth.emailLink with smtp), invites (auth.inviteTtlHours, auth.autoJoinDomains) and smtp for invite emails; values-gcp.yaml carries a commented example. Requires a selfhost-api image from relaycontrol #13 or later and a dashboard image from relay-dashboard #92 or later for the Members invite UI; 0.3.11 pins both in values-gcp.yaml. With none of these values set every render is byte-identical apart from the helm.sh/chart labels. Supersedes the never-released 0.3.8 and includes its changes: Bundles relay-cloud-api 0.2.3, which adds integrations.<provider>.existingSecret: the customer's own OAuth app per integration (client ID from the Secret, client secret mounted as a file), for just-in-time connects from the CLI, flow onboarding and flow creation. Register <publicUrl>/api/v1/integrations/oauth/callback in each provider app. Requires a selfhost-api built from relaycontrol with operator OAuth apps (selfhost/jit-integrations). Supersedes the never-released 0.3.7 and includes its changes: A GKE proof-overlay and documentation patch of 0.3.6: values-gcp-proof-live.yaml sets relay-dashboard.customerProfile.desktop (urlScheme and siteUrl of the proof's custom Desktop build) (folds helm-charts #46), and relay-dashboard chart 0.1.3 documents customerProfile.desktop in its README. The Connect your agents link needs a dashboard image from relay-dashboard #88 or later; the overlay's own dashboard digest (53d484b) predates it, and the live proof deploy overrides that digest. Templates, images and values-gcp.yaml are unchanged from 0.3.6; renders differ only in the helm.sh/chart labels, plus DASHBOARD_CUSTOMER_PROFILE in the gcp-proof-live render. |

From 0.3.5: opt-in single-host mode (global.singleHost.host, off by default): the dashboard and the control API share one host (/, /cloud/api, /login, /api), relay-cloud-api 0.2.2 derives publicUrl and the dashboard derives runtime.publicUrl and ingress.host from it, and the GKE Ingress drops the api host; Relaycast, Relay History, Relayfile and durable-actors keep their own hosts (README Single-host mode). New in 0.3.6: relay-dashboard chart 0.1.2 adds the optional customerProfile (enterprise branding: product name and title, light/dark logo, favicon, accent and button colors, support link, Powered by Agent Relay) rendered into DASHBOARD_CUSTOMER_PROFILE and served in /runtime-config.js; values-gcp.yaml carries a commented example. Branding needs a dashboard image built from relay-dashboard 8eac2bd or later (which also fixes the sessions sidebar facets); the pinned customer dashboard digest predates it and ignores the value. With single-host mode off and no customerProfile every default render is byte-identical to 0.3.4 apart from the helm.sh/chart labels. Images unchanged from 0.3.4. |

The CI render fixture and customer-images.yaml keep dashboard sha256:9bfc0c6b873411c7a0da60d746883bdef6aafd86a9b733c719500a603890b6fe and RelayHistory sha256:8fbda9bd89dd33994b6b3331fb403c38a25f04e6742050bd717e99661f3544ba. selfhost-api remains fail-closed until published and supplied by digest. The dashboard's same-origin /cloud/api is served by selfhost-api natively (it owns /cloud/api and /login; no ingress rewrite). No HA claim. 0.2.0 adds optional components.durableActors (vendored durable-actors 0.14.6) and components.relayfile, both off by default. relayhistory 0.1.1 adds migrations.drainForWriteHold (two-step write-hold upgrade; the migrate Job waits until no History pod exists, README). relay-cloud-api 0.2.1: telemetry.level defaults to errors (scrubbed error metadata and health only; it takes effect once the install is registered with installId, install key and endpoint, so a default render stays off and a partial registration fails), telemetry.egressTo defaults to empty (restricted egress with https telemetry must list the ingest addresses), the standalone Ingress denies /internal when secretKeys.internalToken is set, and Helm 3.10+ is required. 0.2.1 moved to 96bulls 0.5.5 (interim RelayAuth bearer stays off by default) and supersedes the never-released 0.2.0. |
| relayfile-0.2.0 | unreleased | relayfile 0.2.0 | relayfile: `ghcr.io/agentworkforce/relayfile:0.1.0` |  |  | License-annotation bump of 0.1.1 (unreleased 0.1.2) plus runtime.backend=durable-actors (gateway, session broker: ghcr.io/agentworkforce/relayfile-actors by digest; deploy Job and dev sidecar: relayfile-actors-workspace by digest). Go server image by tag (Chart.appVersion), not digest; default render unchanged. |
| durable-actors-0.14.6 | unreleased | durable-actors 0.14.6 |  |  |  | Vendored TerseAI/durable-actors release chart v0.14.6 (tag commit 5f0a2d62, asset sha256 a489cd15...bee) with the local patches listed in charts/durable-actors/UPSTREAM.md (root global, invoke-only key, host idle timeout, pool-manager name length, zero-valued bounds, lowercase ingress host, schema patterns, README links). Never published by this repo; images pinned by upstream digest (charts/durable-actors/UPSTREAM.md). |

## Profiles

Each profile lists what the operator must provide (requirements) and what they can choose (options). `provided by` says who satisfies it in that profile: `operator` (you, before install), `chart` (rendered by the chart), `migrator` (the HoopDb migrate Job), or `stack` (the AWS/GCP infrastructure stack). Items marked **planned** are not implemented: no chart reads them yet.

### Profile: selfhost-postgres

**New self-host install, in-cluster CloudNativePG HoopDb.** initdb creates the search Worker role; the runtime-role and function-default Jobs run as postgres before migrate on every deploy; in-cluster MinIO Locker.

### Requirements

#### req.k8s.cnpg-operator

<a id="req-k8s-cnpg-operator"></a>

**CloudNativePG operator installed** · shipped · chart `sessions-pipeline` · profiles selfhost-postgres, migration, aws-cnpg

The in-cluster HoopDb is a CloudNativePG Cluster (cnpg/cluster 0.9.0), so the
CNPG operator and its CRDs must be installed before the release. Pinned
operator values are in deps/cnpg-operator-values.yaml.

- Provided by: default: operator, aws-cnpg: stack
- Values: `hoopdb.enabled`
- Verify: kubectl get crd clusters.postgresql.cnpg.io && kubectl get deploy -A -l app.kubernetes.io/name=cloudnative-pg
- Sources: [`charts/sessions-pipeline/Chart.yaml:12`](../charts/sessions-pipeline/Chart.yaml#L12), [`charts/sessions-pipeline/values.yaml:85`](../charts/sessions-pipeline/values.yaml#L85), [`deps/pins.txt:4`](../deps/pins.txt#L4), `sessions-pipeline@7d7229b:stacks/aws/hardening.ts:375`

#### req.k8s.storage

<a id="req-k8s-storage"></a>

**A default StorageClass for the in-cluster HoopDb and Locker volumes** · shipped · chart `sessions-pipeline` · profiles selfhost-postgres, migration, aws-cnpg

The CNPG HoopDb claims hoopdb.cluster.storage.size (10Gi) and the MinIO Locker
locker.persistence.size (20Gi) through the default StorageClass.

- Provided by: default: operator, aws-cnpg: stack
- Values: `hoopdb.cluster.storage.size`, `locker.persistence.size`
- Verify: kubectl get storageclass (one marked default), then kubectl get pvc -n <ns> all Bound
- Sources: [`charts/sessions-pipeline/values.yaml:102`](../charts/sessions-pipeline/values.yaml#L102), [`charts/sessions-pipeline/values.yaml:155`](../charts/sessions-pipeline/values.yaml#L155)

#### req.k8s.workload-identity

<a id="req-k8s-workload-identity"></a>

**Workload identity for the Locker bucket (EKS Pod Identity / GKE Workload Identity)** · shipped · chart `sessions-pipeline` · profiles aws-cnpg, aws-supabase, gcp-cloudsql

With locker.credentials.mode=podIdentity the charts omit LOCKER_ACCESS_KEY_ID and
LOCKER_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY and the SDK uses the workload identity chain. Install
the EKS Pod Identity Agent (unless EKS Auto Mode) and create the IAM
associations for the rendered worker and alleyoop ServiceAccounts before the
workloads start (GKE: Workload Identity bindings via serviceAccount.annotations).
The role needs the bucket, and bucket creation plus versioning unless
lockerInit is disabled.

- Provided by: stack
- Values: `worker.locker.credentials.mode`, `alleyoop.locker.credentials.mode`, `worker.serviceAccount.annotations`, `alleyoop.serviceAccount.annotations`
- Verify: aws eks list-pod-identity-associations --cluster-name <c> (one per worker/alleyoop ServiceAccount); then the locker-init Job (or a worker) reaches the bucket
- Sources: [`README.md:152`](../README.md#L152), [`charts/sessions-pipeline-worker/values.yaml:60`](../charts/sessions-pipeline-worker/values.yaml#L60), [`charts/sessions-pipeline-worker/templates/_env.tpl:77`](../charts/sessions-pipeline-worker/templates/_env.tpl#L77)

externalSecrets.enabled renders an ExternalSecret (external-secrets.io/v1) whose
target is existingSecret. The ESO CRDs and the named secretStoreRef must exist,
and every consumed key must be mapped in externalSecrets.data.

- Provided by: operator
- Values: `sessions-pipeline-worker:externalSecrets.*`, `alleyoop:externalSecrets.*`
- Verify: kubectl get crd externalsecrets.external-secrets.io && kubectl get clustersecretstore <name>; the ExternalSecret reports Ready

**Pull Secret for the private GHCR services image** · shipped · chart `sessions-pipeline` · profiles selfhost-postgres, migration, external-selfhosted, external-supabase, aws-supabase, gcp-cloudsql

ghcr.io/agentworkforce/96bulls-services is a private package. Create a
docker-registry Secret and list it in the umbrella's shared imagePullSecrets
(worker and alleyoop; the privileged SQL Jobs reuse worker.imagePullSecrets).
The ECR path (EKS node role) needs none.

- Provided by: operator
- Values: `worker.imagePullSecrets`, `alleyoop.imagePullSecrets`
- Secret: `<pull secret>`; keys . type kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson with read access to ghcr.io/agentworkforce/96bulls-services

#### req.secret.locker-credentials

<a id="req-secret-locker-credentials"></a>

**Locker credential Secret (MinIO root / S3 static keys)** · shipped · chart `sessions-pipeline` · profiles selfhost-postgres, migration, external-selfhosted, external-supabase

In secret mode the workers and alleyoop read the Locker access key pair from
existingSecret, and the bundled MinIO reads its root credential from the same
Secret (locker.existingSecret). Not used with locker.credentials.mode=podIdentity.

- Provided by: operator

**Summary encryption keyring (SUMMARY_MASTER_KEYS)** · shipped · chart `sessions-pipeline` · profiles selfhost-postgres, migration, external-selfhosted, external-supabase, aws-cnpg, aws-supabase, gcp-cloudsql

Bob Costas encrypts summary objects before they reach the Locker. The keyring
("<key-id>:<64 hex>[,<key-id>:<64 hex>...]", first is current) comes only from
a Secret and is projected as a read-only file into Bob Costas only
(SUMMARY_MASTER_KEYS_FILE). summaryEncryption.existingSecret empty follows
worker.existingSecret; pod-identity installs with no shared Secret must set it.

- Provided by: default: operator, aws-cnpg: stack, aws-supabase: stack, gcp-cloudsql: stack

#### req.secret.hoopdb-url

<a id="req-secret-hoopdb-url"></a>

**HoopDb connection Secret (HOOPDB_URL)** · shipped · chart `sessions-pipeline` · profiles selfhost-postgres, migration, external-selfhosted, external-supabase, aws-cnpg, aws-supabase, gcp-cloudsql

Every workload and migrate read HOOPDB_URL from hoopdb.existingSecret/key (else
existingSecret / secretKeys.hoopdbUrl). With the in-cluster HoopDb it is the
Secret CloudNativePG generates (hoopdb-app, key uri): nothing to create. With an
external database the operator (or the stack) creates it; for supabase it is the
migration role's connection string unless migrations.hoopdb separates them.

- Provided by: default: chart, external-selfhosted: operator, external-supabase: operator, aws-supabase: stack, gcp-cloudsql: stack
- Values: `worker.hoopdb.existingSecret`, `worker.hoopdb.key`, `worker.secretKeys.hoopdbUrl`, `alleyoop.hoopdb.existingSecret`, `alleyoop.hoopdb.key`, `alleyoop.secretKeys.hoopdbUrl`

<a id="req-secret-hoopdb-migration-url"></a>

**Separate migration-owner connection Secret (HOOPDB_MIGRATION_URL)** · shipped · chart `sessions-pipeline` · profiles gcp-cloudsql

On Cloud SQL the services connect as the least-privilege runtime role and only
the migrate Job (and its wait-for-role) connects as the migration owner, from
migrations.hoopdb.existingSecret/key.

- Provided by: stack
- Values: `worker.migrations.hoopdb.existingSecret`, `worker.migrations.hoopdb.key`
- Secret: `96bulls-gcp` from `worker.migrations.hoopdb.existingSecret`; keys `HOOPDB_MIGRATION_URL` from `worker.migrations.hoopdb.key`

The org this install ingests for; every profile leaves it to the operator and the render fails without it.

- Provided by: operator
- Values: `global.tenant.orgId`, `worker.tenant.orgId`, `alleyoop.tenant.orgId`
- Env: `TENANT_ORG_ID`
- Verify: helm template renders (it fails with "tenant.orgId (or global.tenant.orgId) is required" otherwise)

**A RelayAuth JWKS URL reachable from alleyoop** · shipped · chart `sessions-pipeline` · profiles selfhost-postgres, migration, external-selfhosted, external-supabase, aws-cnpg, aws-supabase, gcp-cloudsql

alleyoop verifies courier tokens against RelayAuth's JWKS (RELAYAUTH_JWKS_URL).
Point it at a RelayAuth install (the relayauth profile, with its JWKS ingress or
in-cluster Service) or the hosted issuer. Every profile leaves it to the operator.

#### req.db.postgres-17-extensions

<a id="req-db-postgres-17-extensions"></a>

The session directory migrations run CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_trgm and
btree_gin WITH SCHEMA public (both trusted, so the migration owner can create
them). The standard search profile (postgres, pg_trgm GIN indexes) relies on
them. The chart's in-cluster HoopDb uses the CNPG standard Postgres 17 image and
also creates vector and pg_trgm at initdb; the chart documents vector for
external databases too, though the migrations at 7d7229b do not use it.

- Provided by: default: chart, external-selfhosted: operator, external-supabase: operator, aws-supabase: operator, gcp-cloudsql: stack
- Values: `hoopdb.cluster.imageName`, `hoopdb.cluster.initdb.postInitApplicationSQL`

**A database dedicated to HoopDb** · shipped · chart `sessions-pipeline` · profiles selfhost-postgres, migration, aws-cnpg, external-selfhosted, gcp-cloudsql

global-default-revoke sets the global function default of the migration owner
and every superuser in the HoopDb database; that is safe only because the
database holds nothing else. The in-cluster HoopDb is dedicated by construction.

- Provided by: default: chart, external-selfhosted: operator, gcp-cloudsql: stack

**Supabase compatibility roles (anon, authenticated, service_role)** · shipped · chart `sessions-pipeline` · profiles selfhost-postgres, migration, aws-cnpg, external-selfhosted, external-supabase, aws-supabase, gcp-cloudsql

The migrations GRANT to the Supabase roles. CNPG initdb creates them as
superuser; on plain external Postgres the migrator's shim creates them
(HOOPDB_SUPABASE_SHIM=true); on Cloud SQL the operator's
cloudsql_migration_roles.sql does (shim off); Supabase has them natively.

- Provided by: default: chart, external-selfhosted: migrator, external-supabase: operator, aws-supabase: operator, gcp-cloudsql: operator

byte-equal to the courier's RELAYAUTH_HISTORY_ORIGIN. Set, it is also
what turns on verification of courier assertions with the interim bearer
off; this needs a 96bulls-services image built from sessions-pipeline

RelayAuth assertions minted for exactly that origin (RS256 against the
configured JWKS, auth.jwksUrl or auth.localJwks, issuer auth.issuer,
the dedicated History assertion class; services image requirement under
opt.alleyoop.history-origin), and without it every bearer is refused. true accepts any RelayAuth-signed bearer, including
the legacy shared audience, and is allowed only with environment=local;

transport https, telemetry.endpoint are set, the chart renders off, so a
default install renders and sends nothing; setting only some of them
fails the render. transport file never sends

health probes and flat deployment-shape keys (scalar values only; the

telemetry.egressTo is added only when networkPolicy.enabled=true,
allowAllEgress=false, the level is not off and the transport is https.

global.singleHost.host (off when empty) puts the dashboard and the
self-host control API on one host: / to the dashboard and /cloud/api,
/login and /api to relay-cloud-api (flows workers and the integrations
OAuth callback use <publicUrl>/api/v1/...). relay-cloud-api.publicUrl

relay-dashboard.ingress.host as the bare <host>; each must be left empty
or equal its derived value. The GKE
Ingress then renders no api host and its ManagedCertificate drops it;
the api and cast BackendConfigs are unchanged. The leaf dashboard
Ingress (non-GKE edges) adds the /api route. Relaycast, Relay History,
Relayfile and durable-actors cannot run under a path prefix without app
changes, so they keep their own hosts and the chart fails when any of
their public URLs or leaf ingress hosts uses the single host. No service
on the single host needs a path rewrite, so the GCE Ingress is kept
rather than Gateway API.

#### opt.agent-relay.gke-ingress

<a id="opt-agent-relay-gke-ingress"></a>

**Single GKE ingress for the proof hosts** · shipped · chart `agent-relay` · profiles agent-relay

One GCE Ingress uses the reserved global address, one ManagedCertificate
for all four hosts and a FrontendConfig HTTPS redirect. Leaf ingresses
are disabled and all ClusterIP backends use standalone NEGs. /internal is
denied at the edge on the cast and api hosts. The api Service is bound
(cloud.google.com/backend-config) to a BackendConfig whose timeoutSec
(gkeIngress.backends.api.timeoutSec, at least 60, default 3600) keeps the
flows worker queue SSE stream open past GCE's 30s default. The
BackendConfig is named <gkeIngress.name>-api (the name truncated to 59
characters first); relay-cloud-api renders the annotation from
relay-cloud-api.service.backendConfig, which must equal that name (the
render fails with the expected name otherwise). The relaycast Service is
bound the same way to <gkeIngress.name>-cast (the name truncated to 58
characters; gkeIngress.backends.cast.timeoutSec, default 3600) through
relaycast.service.backendConfig, so Relaycast WebSockets stay open.

<a id="opt-relayfile-durable-actors"></a>

**Relayfile runtime backend (go or durable-actors)** · shipped · chart `relayfile` · profiles relayfile-durable-actors, agent-relay-durable-actors

durable-actors replaces the Go server with the relayfile-actors gateway (same
Service/Ingress/HPA/NetworkPolicy), adds the session broker and the deploy Job,
and stores file bytes in GCS (Workload Identity via serviceAccount.annotations)
or S3. devRuntime runs `durable-actors dev` as a sidecar for kind/CI only.

## Pod plumbing env (not operator-facing)

Rendered by the charts but not a requirement or an option: fixed by the chart or derived from other values.

| env | chart | why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SERVICE` | sessions-pipeline-worker, alleyoop | selects the entry point of the one services image |
| `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME` | sessions-pipeline-worker, alleyoop | equals SERVICE |
| `TMPDIR` | sessions-pipeline-worker, alleyoop | the writable emptyDir under a read-only root filesystem |
| `HOME` | sessions-pipeline, sessions-pipeline-worker, relayflows | a writable home under a read-only root filesystem |
| `ROLES` | sessions-pipeline-worker | wait-for-role init container; derived from waitForRole.role and migrations.runtimeRole |
| `FUNCTION_DEFAULT` | sessions-pipeline-worker | wait-for-role init container; derived from waitForRole.functionDefault |
| `INTERVAL` | sessions-pipeline-worker | wait-for-role poll interval (waitForRole.intervalSeconds) |
| `CLUSTER` | sessions-pipeline | privileged SQL Jobs; the CNPG cluster name (bootstrapJob.cluster) |
| `DATABASE` | sessions-pipeline | privileged SQL Jobs; the HoopDb database (bootstrapJob.database) |
| `INGEST_PORT` | alleyoop | from ingest.port |
| `PORT` | relaycast, relayauth | from server.port |
| `RELAYCAST_DB_PATH` | relaycast | fixed /data/relaycast.db on the data PVC |
| `RELAYCAST_ENV` | relaycast | reserved name in the extraEnv guard; the environment is passed as --env (server.environment) |
| `RELAYCAST_INTERNAL_SECRET` | relaycast | reserved prefix in the extraEnv guard; the Secret is mounted as a file |
| `RELAYCAST_WORKSPACE_BOOTSTRAP_SECRET` | relaycast | reserved prefix in the extraEnv guard; the Secret is mounted as a file |
| `RELAYCAST_RELAYAUTH` | relaycast | reserved prefix in the extraEnv guard; the RelayAuth remote tagger is wired through credentials.relayauth.url and secretKeys.relayauthToken |
| `RELAYCAST_CREDENTIAL` | relaycast | reserved prefix in the extraEnv guard; the credential format and local keyring are wired through credentials.* and secretKeys.credentialKeyring |
| `BACKUP_KEEP` | relaycast | backup CronJob; from backup.keep |
| `LOCK_STALE_MS` | relaycast | backup CronJob lock timeout (fixed) |
| `RELAYAUTH_DB_PATH` | relayauth | fixed path on the data PVC |
| `NPM_CONFIG_CACHE` | relayflows | runtime installer cache in an emptyDir |

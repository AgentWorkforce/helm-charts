# Builds the development-preview customer handoff from HEAD, verifies both
# archive formats, extracts the tar.gz, and proves the extracted umbrella is
# installable on its own: helm dependency build + helm template with the
# shipped values-gcp.yaml. Also reports (as warnings) relative Markdown links
# in shipped documents that point outside the archive; the generated
# requirements doc links repository sources by design.
#
# Requires: git, python3, helm (with the cnpg/minio/open-telemetry
# repositories added, as in the lint workflow), tar, unzip.

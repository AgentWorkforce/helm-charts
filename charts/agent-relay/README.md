# agent-relay

Umbrella chart for the self-hosted messaging and Sessions proof:

- Relaycast and RelayAuth
- Sessions Pipeline
- Relay History
- self-host control-plane API
- static dashboard

Relayflows is an optional add-on (`components.relayflows`, off by default;
see `docs/self-hosted-relayflows.md`). Relayfile (`components.relayfile`) and
the durable-actors control plane (`components.durableActors`) are optional and
off by default; see `docs/self-hosted-durable-actors.md`.

Requires Helm 3.10 or newer: the relay-cloud-api subchart uses
`{{ continue }}`, which older Helm versions cannot parse.

## Customer-neutral GCP template

`values-gcp.yaml` is the customer-neutral starting point for a full GKE
deployment. It is derived from the proof configuration but uses only
`example-*` resource names, `placeholder.company` hosts, and customer-owned
Artifact Registry placeholders. It contains Secret names and keys, never
Secret values.

The template is intentionally renderable: all-zero image digests are sentinel
values, not deployable images. Replace every value marked `REQUIRED OVERRIDE`
before installing. The required value overrides are:

| Values path | Required replacement |
| --- | --- |
| `global.imageRegistry` | Artifact Registry hostname for the selected region, such as `us-central1-docker.pkg.dev`. |
| `global.tenant.orgId` | Stable customer organization ID. Do not change it after data has been written. |
| `gkeIngress.name`, `staticIpName`, `managedCertificateName`, `frontendConfigName` | Customer-selected names. `staticIpName` must name a reserved global external IPv4 address; the chart creates the other resources. |
| `gkeIngress.hosts.{root,api,cast,history}` | Four customer-controlled public DNS names whose A records point at the reserved address. |
| `relaycast.image.{repository,digest}` | Customer-accessible Relaycast image mirror and its real immutable digest. |
| `relayauth.image.{repository,digest}` | Customer-accessible RelayAuth image mirror and its real immutable digest. |
| `sessions-pipeline.worker.image.{repository,digest}` and `sessions-pipeline.alleyoop.image.{repository,digest}` | Repository path under `global.imageRegistry` and the same immutable Sessions services digest. |
| `relayhistory.image.{repository,digest}` | Customer-accessible Relay History image mirror and its real immutable digest. |
| `relay-cloud-api.image.{repository,digest}` | Customer-accessible control API image mirror and its real immutable digest. |
| `relay-dashboard.image.{repository,digest}` | Customer-accessible dashboard image mirror and its real immutable digest. |
| All `existingSecret` values set to `example-agent-relay-secrets` | Name of a pre-created Secret in the release namespace. Update every occurrence if separate Secrets are used. |
| `sessions-pipeline.{worker,alleyoop}.locker.bucket` | Existing customer-owned GCS bucket used for session objects. Both values must match. |
| `sessions-pipeline.{worker,alleyoop}.locker.region` | Region of that bucket. Both values must match. |
| `sessions-pipeline.worker.extraEnv` (shared with `alleyoop.extraEnv` through a YAML anchor) | Cloud SQL connection name, Memorystore host/port/server CA bundle, and Pub/Sub topic and subscription. `locker.provider=gcs` arms the Sessions services' GCS data-path readiness check, which requires them; the chart refuses to render without them. |
| `relaycast.baseUrl` | `https://` plus `gkeIngress.hosts.cast`. |
| `relayhistory.relayauth.historyOrigin` | `https://` plus `gkeIngress.hosts.history`. |
| `sessions-pipeline.alleyoop.auth.historyOrigin` | Same origin as `relayhistory.relayauth.historyOrigin` (the History assertion audience couriers use). The umbrella refuses to render when the two differ. |
| `relay-cloud-api.publicUrl` | `https://` plus `gkeIngress.hosts.api`. |
| `relay-cloud-api.services.relaycastPublicUrl` | Same origin as `relaycast.baseUrl`. |
| `relay-cloud-api.services.relayhistoryPublicUrl` | Same origin as `relayhistory.relayauth.historyOrigin`. |
| `relay-dashboard.runtime.publicUrl` | `https://` plus `gkeIngress.hosts.root`. |
| `relay-cloud-api.service.backendConfig` | `<gkeIngress.name>-api` (the name truncated to 59 characters first). The umbrella renders that BackendConfig and refuses any other value. |
| `relaycast.service.backendConfig` | `<gkeIngress.name>-cast` (the name truncated to 58 characters first), for the Relaycast WebSocket backend timeout. |

The referenced Secret must provide these keys:

- Relaycast: `relaycast-internal-secret` (at least 32 characters) and
  `relaycast-workspace-bootstrap-secret`
- RelayAuth: `relayauth-internal-secret`,
  `relayauth-signing-key.pem`, and `relayauth-bootstrap-api-key`
- Sessions: `HOOPDB_URL`, `HOOPDB_MIGRATION_URL`, and
  `SUMMARY_MASTER_KEYS`
- Relay History: `DATABASE_URL` and `DATABASE_MIGRATIONS_URL`
- control API: `database-url`, `database-migrations-url`,
  `relayauth-api-key`, `selfhost-bootstrap-token`, and
  `selfhost-encryption-key`
- RelayAuth-issued relaycast credentials (optional, model B):
  `relaycast-credential-keyring` and `relaycast-relayauth-token`
- Sign-in (optional; see "First boot and sign-in" below): `oidc-client-secret`
  for OIDC, and `smtp-password` for SMTP with a username. The bootstrap reads
  the existing `relaycast-internal-secret` key.

`relayauth-api-key` and `relayauth-bootstrap-api-key` must contain the same
value. `selfhost-bootstrap-token` must be at least 32 bytes.
`selfhost-encryption-key` must encode exactly 32 bytes as either 64 hexadecimal
characters or base64.

### First boot and sign-in

Without extra steps, a fresh install has no organization. It also has no way
to sign in except the operator break-glass, where the bootstrap token approves
a device code. Set the commented `relay-cloud-api` block in `values-gcp.yaml`
to get a working team straight from `helm install`. This needs a selfhost-api
image from relaycontrol #13 or later.

- `relay-cloud-api.bootstrap.{orgName,adminEmail}`,
  `relay-cloud-api.secretKeys.relaycastInternalSecret: relaycast-internal-secret`
  and `relay-cloud-api.dashboardUrl: https://<root host>/`. On its first start
  the API:
  - creates the organization and makes the admin its owner;
  - creates a `Default` workspace bound to a new Relaycast workspace.

  This is idempotent and safe on an existing install.
- `relay-cloud-api.auth.oidc.{issuer,clientId,allowedDomains}` plus
  `secretKeys.oidcClientSecret`. Register
  `https://<root host>/login/oidc/callback` with the identity provider:
  - Google Workspace: an Internal Web-application OAuth client, issuer
    `https://accounts.google.com`;
  - Okta: `https://<org>.okta.com/oauth2/default`;
  - Entra ID: `https://login.microsoftonline.com/<tenant>/v2.0`.
- Optional `relay-cloud-api.smtp.*`: invite emails, and email sign-in links
  with `auth.emailLink.enabled`.

The admin signs in at `https://<root host>/login`. Owners and admins then
invite teammates from Settings → Members. Invite links are single use and
expiring. They are emailed when SMTP is set, and can always be copied.

With `relaycast.credentials.authority=relayauth` (model B, see the commented
`credentials` block in `values-gcp.yaml`), RelayAuth owns the `ar_` credential
tag keyring and pushes `ar_ws_` workspace keys into Relaycast, which verifies
tags through RelayAuth's remote CredentialTagger. The shared Secret then needs
`relaycast-credential-keyring` (mounted by relayauth) and
`relaycast-relayauth-token` (mounted by relaycast); relayauth also mounts
`relaycast-internal-secret` to call Relaycast's internal admin API. It
requires `components.relayauth=true` and a >=12.3.x relaycast engine image.

When `components.relayflows=true` with `mode=cloudWorker`, the Secret named by
`relayflows.credentials.existingSecret` must contain the worker enrollment
token under `relayflows.credentials.existingSecretKey` (default
`AGENT_RELAY_WORKER_ENROLLMENT_TOKEN`). Alternatively
`relayflows.credentials.enrollmentToken` renders a chart-managed Secret — the
only case in which this chart renders Secret material. Standalone mode needs
no enrollment Secret; model and provider credentials reach the flow through
`relayflows.extraEnv`/`extraEnvFrom`.

The template assumes external Cloud SQL and GCS rather than in-cluster
Postgres and MinIO. Before installation, provision separate Sessions, Relay
History, and control API databases; install the Sessions database extensions
and migrations required by the Sessions Pipeline; and make each runtime URL use the
least-privilege role named in the values (`sessions_runtime` or
`control_api_runtime`). Migration URLs must use the corresponding
migration-owner roles. Relay History must have its own database and migration
ledger.

Sessions objects use the services' native GCS adapter
(`locker.provider=gcs`, `LOCKER_PROVIDER=gcs`) with an empty endpoint, which
means the official `https://storage.googleapis.com` API. The services refuse
HMAC keys on GCS and refuse the S3 client against a GCS endpoint, so there is
no S3-interoperability mode. Grant the rendered Sessions worker and Alleyoop
Kubernetes service accounts GCS access through GKE Workload Identity, and grant GKE nodes or configured
image pull identities read access to every Artifact Registry repository. No
cloud credential belongs in this values file.

The umbrella Ingress is a global external GKE Application Load Balancer with
standalone NEGs. Each public backend NetworkPolicy admits its application port
from same-namespace pods and from the Google Front End proxy/health-check
ranges `35.191.0.0/16` and `130.211.0.0/22`. No other external source range is
allowed. The chart fails rendering when `gkeIngress.enabled=true` and any
public backend disables its policy or omits one of these three sources.

These Kubernetes policies do not replace the corresponding VPC firewall rule.
GKE normally creates that rule for an Ingress; Shared VPC deployments where
the service-project GKE identity cannot manage host-project firewall rules
must have an administrator allow the same two Google ranges to the NEG
backends on their serving ports. See the
[GKE Ingress firewall guidance](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/load-balance-ingress#shared_vpc).

Render the template before supplying any credentials:

```sh
helm lint . -f values-gcp.yaml
helm template agent-relay . -n agent-relay -f values-gcp.yaml >/dev/null
```

`values-gcp-proof.yaml` is the portable, all-components customer shape.
`values-gcp-proof-live.yaml` is a separate overlay for the existing proof
cluster; it reuses RelayAuth in the `relayauth` namespace, disables the
already-running Sessions Pipeline, and inherits the portable profile's
restricted GKE NetworkPolicies.

One umbrella GKE Ingress reserves a global static address
(`gkeIngress.staticIpName`), uses one Google ManagedCertificate for all
four hosts, and enables HTTP-to-HTTPS redirect through a FrontendConfig.
For a base domain `relay.example.com`:

- `relay.example.com`: `/cloud/api` and `/login` to the control API,
  then `/` to the dashboard
- `api.relay.example.com`: the same control-plane API Service
- `cast.relay.example.com`: Relaycast
- `history.relay.example.com`: Relay History

Leaf ingresses are disabled and each ClusterIP backend uses a GKE standalone
NEG. Sensitive Relaycast paths still route to an endpoint-less deny Service.

## Single-host mode

The per-service hosts above are the default. Single-host mode is opt-in: set
`global.singleHost.host` and the dashboard and the self-host control API share
that one host. `values-single-host-example.yaml` is an overlay for
`values-gcp.yaml`:

```sh
helm template agent-relay . -n agent-relay -f values-gcp.yaml -f values-single-host-example.yaml
```

For `global.singleHost.host: relay.example.com`:

- `relay.example.com`: `/cloud/api`, `/login` and `/api` to the control API,
  then `/` to the dashboard. `/api` carries the flows worker endpoints and the
  integrations OAuth callback, which relaycontrol hands out as
  `<publicUrl>/api/v1/...`; it is not routed in the default mode, where the
  api host serves them.
- There is no api host. Point Desktop's custom origin and `agent-relay login`
  at `https://relay.example.com`; Desktop derives `/cloud/api` from it.
- `cast.relay.example.com` and `history.relay.example.com` (and
  `gkeIngress.hosts.files`/`actors` when set) stay separate hosts, see below.
  The ManagedCertificate covers the single host plus those hosts.

Set the host once. `relay-cloud-api.publicUrl` and
`relay-dashboard.runtime.publicUrl` are derived as `https://<host>`, and
`relay-dashboard.ingress.host` as the bare `<host>`; the chart fails if any of
them is set to something else. `gkeIngress.hosts.root`
must be empty (or equal the host) and `gkeIngress.hosts.api` must be empty.
`relay-cloud-api.dashboardUrl` can stay empty: its default, `publicUrl + "/"`,
is the dashboard in this mode. Without the GKE Ingress, enable the
`relay-dashboard` leaf Ingress: it routes the same four paths on the derived
host. `relay-cloud-api.ingress.enabled` must stay `false`.

The api BackendConfig (flows worker queue SSE timeout) still binds the
relay-cloud-api Service, so it covers `/cloud/api` and `/api` on the single
host; the cast BackendConfig (WebSocket timeout) and the edge-deny routes on the
cast host are unchanged. With `global.singleHost.host` empty, every default
render is byte-identical to the previous release apart from the
`helm.sh/chart` labels; `ci/agent-relay/subdomain-golden.sh` checks it in CI
and `ci/agent-relay/subdomain-golden.sh diff origin/main` shows any change.

### What can share the host

| Service | Under a path prefix on the single host | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| relay-dashboard | Works as is, at `/` | Assets are built for `/`; it calls only same-origin `/cloud/api`. |
| relaycontrol (relay-cloud-api) | Works as is, at `/cloud/api`, `/login`, `/api` | It serves those paths natively (`/cloud/api/v1/*` aliases `/api/v1/*`), so nothing is stripped. `publicUrl` is the single host. `/internal` is not routed. |
| Relaycast | Needs an app change; stays on its own host | The relaycast-self-host entrypoint refuses a `--base-url` with a path. The TypeScript SDK joins with `new URL('/v1/...', base)`, which drops `/cast`. relaycontrol (`RELAYCAST_PUBLIC_URL`) and Desktop (`validated_base_url`, which silently falls back to `cast.agentrelay.com`) refuse a path-prefixed URL. The A2A, inbound-hook and relayfile-inbound URLs are built from the request origin. Prefix stripping alone fixes none of these. |
| Relay History | Needs an app change; stays on its own host | The server would work behind prefix stripping, but `relayhistoryPublicUrl` is both the History assertion audience (a bare origin) and the base URL relaycontrol hands clients, and relaycontrol and Desktop refuse a path. |
| Relayfile | Needs an app change; stays on its own host | The server and actors gateway would work behind prefix stripping, but the mount and `listen` clients build WebSocket URLs by replacing the path, which drops `/files`. |
| durable-actors | Needs an app change; stays on its own host | The control plane refuses a `publicUrl` with a path and issues actor sockets at `<origin>/v1/socket`; the SDK refuses a base path. |

The chart enforces the last four rows: in single-host mode `gkeIngress.hosts.cast`
and `history` are still required, and rendering fails when `relaycast.baseUrl`,
`relayhistory.relayauth.historyOrigin`, `relay-cloud-api.services.*PublicUrl`,
`sessions-pipeline.alleyoop.auth.historyOrigin`, `durable-actors.publicUrl` or
a Relaycast, Relay History or Relayfile leaf ingress host uses the single host.

GCE Ingress cannot rewrite paths. GKE Gateway API (`HTTPRoute` with a
`URLRewrite` `ReplacePrefixMatch` filter) can, but it would mean replacing the
ManagedCertificate, FrontendConfig and BackendConfigs with Certificate Manager,
an HTTP redirect route and `GCPBackendPolicy`. Nothing that can share the host
today needs a rewrite, so single-host mode keeps the GCE Ingress. Once the app
changes above land, a Gateway API variant can strip `/cast`, `/history`,
`/files` and `/actors`.

All application credentials come from existing Secrets. The deployment values
contain no credentials and no imagePullSecret reference. Rendering fails until
all required immutable digests are present. The live proof
(`values-gcp-proof-live.yaml`) pins these proof-registry builds:

- dashboard: `sha256:23361e08b899f272ed5debcbd4e7d6c6555591029357d6fba6c54236063bca62`
  (relay-dashboard `53d484b`, the self-host build served at `/`)
- selfhost API: `sha256:99670d253b88c27499f6c4cca6ac1265ed97978ed7a9d5eaaeecd65de9e052dc`
  (relaycontrol `17bdc78`)
- experimental RelayHistory: `sha256:f36ae1671bdcd88a2b8b2df62c8edecb1381237d9f968747b39298959ad33563`
  (relayhistory-cloud `3cb76752`, branch `proof/erasure-turns-on-4b5839f`, the
  erasure-fix proof build whose 0074 arms the write hold; the CI render
  fixture keeps `sha256:8fbda9bd89dd33994b6b3331fb403c38a25f04e6742050bd717e99661f3544ba`)

`values-gcp-proof-durable-actors.yaml` pins the relaycast actors gateway
`sha256:026e8c1b1e78b2946c53871e8e5701e0cac9b6121c2b4124cd376ceece33cb45` and
deployer `sha256:9b9fee183167a169370c20950caf63824417b8064ea7e1ef4bd00026ab5fd106`
(relaycast main `46281074`, PR #622: the workspace bootstrap secret and proof policy); `values-gcp-proof-relayfile.yaml` pins relayfile-actors
`sha256:7fb2110701a004f9f7ed2b025d25156fbe993208598bfbd0498a48b30df48299` and
relayfile-actors-workspace
`sha256:c5851a1b1f7624390a1a00ebdee69e8e521dc3f23f345c582d62e09dba9a6e83`
(relayfile main `39f84fcf`, PR #557).

These are proof-only identities. The release gate audits the customer profile
(`values-gcp.yaml`) against `self-hosted/customer-images.yaml`, which records
the CI render fixture's dashboard digest (`ci/gcp-proof-values.yaml`) and the
published `ghcr.io/agentworkforce/selfhost-api` digest, not the live pins; a
proof pin never makes an image customer-ready.

The RelayHistory image is an experimental proof build, not a released or
supported artifact.

When a RelayHistory upgrade arms a write hold (the two-step
`relayhistory.migrations.allowWriteHold` + `drainForWriteHold` upgrade in
`charts/relayhistory/README.md`) and `values-gcp-proof-flows.yaml` is applied,
do not pass `--wait-for-jobs` on step 1: the Relayflows smoke Job runs once per
Helm revision and probes History, which has no pods during step 1, so the Job
fails and Helm marks the revision failed although the migration succeeded.
Wait on the migrate Job by name instead; step 2's smoke Job passes. If step 1
did end as a failed revision, step 2 diffs against the last deployed revision,
which never had the drain Role, so Helm leaves the `relayhistory-drain-wait`
Role and RoleBinding behind: delete both after step 2.

The live overlay expects an existing Secret (the portable example names it
`example-agent-relay-secrets`) in the release namespace with these keys
(values are never stored in this repository):

- Relaycast: `relaycast-internal-secret`,
  `relaycast-workspace-bootstrap-secret`
- RelayHistory: `DATABASE_URL`, `DATABASE_MIGRATIONS_URL`
- selfhost-api: `database-url`, `database-migrations-url`,
  `relayauth-api-key`, `selfhost-bootstrap-token`,
  `selfhost-encryption-key`, `selfhost-internal-token` (the live overlay sets
  `relay-cloud-api.secretKeys.internalToken`, which enables `/internal/v1`;
  the api host denies `/internal` at the edge)

With `values-gcp-proof-durable-actors.yaml` (Relaycast in
`runtime.backend=durable-actors`) the Relaycast gateway reads these keys of
the same Secret instead of the two SQLite Relaycast keys above
(`ci/agent-relay/render.sh` checks this exact set):

- `relaycast-credential-keyring` (`{"current":"a","keys":{"a":"<random>"}}`)
- `relaycast-actors-internal-secret` (at least 32 characters; equal to
  `RELAYCAST_INTERNAL_SECRET` in the sandbox Secret `relaycast-actor-env`)
- `relaycast-file-signing-secret` (equal to `RELAYCAST_FILE_SIGNING_SECRET` in
  `relaycast-actor-env`)
- `relaycast-actors-workspace-bootstrap-secret` (48 or more random characters,
  no trailing newline; the same bytes as `RELAYCAST_WORKSPACE_BOOTSTRAP_SECRET`
  in `relaycast-actor-env`, which also carries
  `RELAYCAST_WORKSPACE_BOOTSTRAP_PROOF_REQUIRED` equal to
  `relaycast.bootstrapProofRequired`; see charts/relaycast/README.md, "Keyed
  workspace creates on durable-actors")

It also needs the Secrets `actors-credentials` (`postgres-url`,
`jwt-signing-key`, `api-key`, `invoke-api-key`) and
`relaycast-durable-actors-invoke` (`durable-actors-invoke-key`, equal to
`invoke-api-key`); see docs/self-hosted-durable-actors.md ("GCP provisioning").

`relayauth-api-key` must equal the existing RelayAuth bootstrap API key.
`selfhost-bootstrap-token` must be at least 32 bytes.
`selfhost-encryption-key` must encode exactly 32 bytes as 64 hex characters or
base64. Runtime database URLs should use least-privilege roles; migration URLs
must use the corresponding migration-owner roles.

The portable all-components shape additionally needs
`relayauth-internal-secret`, `relayauth-signing-key.pem`,
`relayauth-bootstrap-api-key`, `HOOPDB_URL`, `HOOPDB_MIGRATION_URL`, and
`SUMMARY_MASTER_KEYS` in that Secret. `relayauth-api-key` and
`relayauth-bootstrap-api-key` must contain the same API-key value.

```sh
helm dependency build charts/sessions-pipeline
helm dependency build charts/agent-relay
helm install agent-relay charts/agent-relay -n agent-relay \
  --create-namespace --no-hooks -f charts/agent-relay/values-gcp-proof.yaml \
  -f charts/agent-relay/values-gcp-proof-live.yaml \
  --set relay-cloud-api.image.digest=sha256:...
```

The proof uses single-writer/single-replica components and makes no HA claim.
Cloud SQL networking and database/user provisioning remain operator work.
RelayHistory must use its own database and migration ledger; do not point it at
the Sessions Pipeline `hoopdb` database. The headless API supports both `/api/v1` and
Desktop/Dashboard `/cloud/api/v1` routes, including secure browser login,
workspace-scoped session search, and replay.

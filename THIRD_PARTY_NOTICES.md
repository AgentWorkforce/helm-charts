# Third-party notices and redistribution status

This file records source and license evidence for software bundled as chart dependencies
or referenced by this Helm chart repository. AgentWorkforce-authored material
in this repository, including first-party Helm chart code, is licensed under
Apache License 2.0 by the root [`LICENSE`](LICENSE). Third-party components
retain their own licenses and notices; this file does not relicense them and
is not legal advice.

Evidence was checked on 2026-11-02 against the dependency chart archives that
`helm dependency build` produced from the committed `Chart.lock` files, and
against the linked upstream repositories. Those archives are not committed
(`*.tgz` is ignored) and the customer handoff does not ship them: they are
fetched at build or release time, pinned by name, version, and the
`Chart.lock` digest. The archives do not contain `LICENSE`, `NOTICE`,
`COPYING`, or `COPYRIGHT` files.

## License scope

The `artifacthub.io/license: Apache-2.0` annotation in each first-party
`Chart.yaml` identifies the license of the AgentWorkforce-authored chart
content. It does not apply Apache-2.0 to bundled chart dependencies, referenced
container images, or application source code maintained in other repositories.
Those materials remain subject to their respective license terms and the
redistribution limits recorded below.

## Third-party Helm chart dependencies

The SHA-256 values are those of the archives fetched on 2026-11-02, recorded
so a rebuilt archive can be compared; they are not files in this repository.
`charts/96bulls/Chart.lock` (digest
`sha256:9f168c6141ecd03c2d88e8d4f6b2420313a0f33f79536eef4f68a4ce7c999de2`)
pins the versions.

`helm dependency build charts/agent-relay` packages the same third-party chart
contents inside `charts/agent-relay/charts/96bulls-0.5.2.tgz`, whose bytes
depend on that local build (one such build had SHA-256
`289b5aebc3a9c6cf58b62c5c23446f15dc03d5979a5cd9fefb0bb26bf0f4b9bc`); it is not
committed or shipped in the handoff. That archive also contains no license or
notice file.

The CloudNativePG operator chart 0.29.1 is an install prerequisite fetched by
CI/release workflows, not a chart dependency of any chart here. Its source is
[`cloudnative-pg/charts` tag `cloudnative-pg-v0.29.1`, commit
`effa01d9a7d6fa390712a83bbadad1784940f2f4`](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/charts/tree/cloudnative-pg-v0.29.1/charts/cloudnative-pg)
and that source repository identifies the chart under Apache License 2.0.

## AgentWorkforce suite components

Licenses found in an application source repository are recorded as source
evidence only. The root `LICENSE` independently covers the first-party Helm
chart code in this repository; it does not prove that a particular image was
built from the identified application source, license that separate source, or
cover an image's transitive packages.

| Component | Source identified by chart metadata | License evidence found |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Relaycast | [`AgentWorkforce/relaycast`](https://github.com/AgentWorkforce/relaycast) | Repository contains an [Apache-2.0 `LICENSE`](https://github.com/AgentWorkforce/relaycast/blob/main/LICENSE). |

## Referenced runtime images

Helm chart archives contain image references, not copies of these images.
Current direct references include:

- `ghcr.io/cloudnative-pg/postgresql:17-standard-trixie@sha256:ed6923f9ba2399cf9070379a353c710c29ced8a294be73986a2c3dae7e599ce3`
- `cgr.dev/chainguard/minio:latest@sha256:e70b2b1e74d79457f808710483bd726ff364529ca30736eaa15a6ab547d3a5a7`
- `otel/opentelemetry-collector-contrib:0.163.2`
- `docker.io/alpine/k8s:1.34.1@sha256:ec714df3813b5405292860f8a1c55c5727bf8c33c88992f1e981efad8065547f`
- `node:22.23.3-bookworm-slim`
- AgentWorkforce application images named in chart values and deployment
  profiles.

If any release bundle copies these images rather than only referencing their
registries, its packaging inputs need image-specific SBOMs, license files,
notices, source/provenance records, and any required source-delivery material.
Those records are not present in this repository, so image redistribution is
not cleared by this notice.

## Remaining redistribution limits

1. **Unlicensed suite sources.** No redistribution license was found for
   `AgentWorkforce/sessions-pipeline`, `AgentWorkforce/relayhistory-cloud`, or
   `AgentWorkforce/cloud`. Any package that copies their application code or
   images remains blocked until the copyright holder supplies applicable
   license terms and required notices. This does not change the Apache-2.0
   license of the Helm chart code in this repository.
2. **Legal files are absent from the Helm packages.** The checked dependency
   third-party archives and the generated `agent-relay`/`96bulls` archives
   contain no license or notice files. Root documentation is not automatically
   included by `helm package`. A release process must deliberately place the
   applicable legal material in each distributed artifact or otherwise define
   and verify the release bundle that accompanies it.
3. **Container redistribution evidence is incomplete.** The chart-only case
   references remote images, but an offline installer or other bundle that
   copies them is blocked pending the image-specific records listed above.

Do not treat the root Apache-2.0 license, chart annotations, or Apache-2.0 files
found in some application repositories as relicensing bundled dependencies,
separate application sources, or container images.

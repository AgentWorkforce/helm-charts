# aws/search

**Optional.** An Amazon OpenSearch Service **VPC domain** as the transcript search index. It replaces ClickHouse; the default stays Postgres `pg_trgm`. It is meant for the sessions pipeline's OpenSearch `SearchIndexAdapter` (sessions-pipeline-cloud); the charts set no value for it.

- VPC domain in your subnets and security groups. Zone awareness follows the number of subnets (2 or 3).
- Encryption at rest (customer key optional), node-to-node encryption, HTTPS enforced with `Policy-Min-TLS-1-2-PFS-2023-10`.
- Fine-grained access control with an **IAM master user** (`master_user_arn`). There is no internal user database and no anonymous access.
- Sized for per-event transcript text: 3 `r7g.large.search` data nodes (4 with two subnets, a multiple of the AZ count) with 200 GiB gp3 each, plus 3 dedicated `m7g.large.search` cluster managers. Every size is a variable.
- **Destroy guard:** OpenSearch has no API deletion protection, so the domain has `prevent_destroy`: Terraform refuses to destroy or replace it. To delete it on purpose, `terraform state rm` the domain resource and delete it with the AWS CLI or console.
- Two workload roles trusted by EKS Pod Identity (and IRSA): **indexer** (the sessions-pipeline search stage: `ESHttpGet/Head/Post/Put/Delete/Patch`) and **reader** (the session read API: `ESHttpGet/Head/Post`). With the master user, map them as `backend_roles` to OpenSearch roles scoped to the transcript indices.
- Pod Identity allows one role per ServiceAccount. When the pod already has a role, set `workload_roles = { create = false }`, attach `indexer_policy_json` / `reader_policy_json` to that role, and list it in `additional_principal_arns`. Do not attach the indexer policy to a role shared with pods that only read. `examples/aws` binds the two roles to their own `indexer_service_account` and `reader_service_account`.
- Application, search-slow and index-slow logs go to CloudWatch. Add `AUDIT_LOGS` once audit logging is configured in the security plugin.
- Prerequisite: the `AWSServiceRoleForAmazonOpenSearchService` service-linked role.

### Inputs

| ---- | ----------- | ---- | ------- | :------: |
| domain\_name | OpenSearch domain name (3-28 characters, lowercase letter first). | `string` | n/a | yes |
| master\_user\_arn | IAM principal ARN that becomes the fine-grained access control master user (an admin role, not a workload role). It maps the indexer and reader roles to OpenSearch roles; see the README. | `string` | n/a | yes |
| security\_group\_ids | Existing security groups for the domain ENIs. Allow TCP 443 only from the indexer and read API pods (or their nodes). | `list(string)` | n/a | yes |
| subnet\_ids | Private subnets for the VPC domain, one per Availability Zone (2 or 3). The zone awareness count follows their number. | `list(string)` | n/a | yes |
| additional\_principal\_arns | Extra IAM principals allowed to send HTTP requests to the domain (still subject to fine-grained access control). | `list(string)` | `[]` | no |
| advanced\_options | Extra OpenSearch advanced options. | `map(string)` | `{}` | no |
| auto\_software\_update\_enabled | Apply service software updates in the off-peak window. | `bool` | `true` | no |
| automated\_snapshot\_start\_hour | Hour (UTC) of the daily automated snapshot. Ignored by OpenSearch 5.3+ domains, which take hourly snapshots. | `number` | `3` | no |
| create\_log\_resource\_policy | Create the CloudWatch Logs resource policy that lets OpenSearch write to the log groups. Disable when the account manages one centrally (the per-region limit is 10). | `bool` | `true` | no |
| dedicated\_master\_count | Cluster manager nodes (3 or 5). | `number` | `3` | no |
| dedicated\_master\_enabled | Dedicated cluster manager nodes (recommended for production). | `bool` | `true` | no |

| ebs\_iops | Provisioned IOPS for gp3 (null uses the baseline). | `number` | `null` | no |
| ebs\_throughput | Provisioned throughput (MiB/s) for gp3 (null uses the baseline). | `number` | `null` | no |
| ebs\_volume\_size | gp3 volume per data node in GiB. Size for the transcript text plus replicas plus ~25% headroom. | `number` | `200` | no |
| ebs\_volume\_type | EBS volume type. | `string` | `"gp3"` | no |
| engine\_version | Engine version (OpenSearch\_X.Y). | `string` | `"OpenSearch_2.19"` | no |
| instance\_count | Data nodes, a multiple of the subnet (AZ) count. null picks the smallest multiple that is at least 3 (3 for one or three AZs, 4 for two). | `number` | `null` | no |
| instance\_type | Data node type. Memory-optimized (r7g) fits a full-text index of transcript events; use or1/or2 (OpenSearch Optimized) for heavy ingest. | `string` | `"r7g.large.search"` | no |
| kms\_key\_arn | Customer managed KMS key for encryption at rest. null uses the AWS managed aws/es key. | `string` | `null` | no |
| log\_kms\_key\_arn | KMS key for the log groups (its key policy must allow CloudWatch Logs). null uses CloudWatch's default encryption. | `string` | `null` | no |
| log\_publishing | CloudWatch log types to publish (ES\_APPLICATION\_LOGS, SEARCH\_SLOW\_LOGS, INDEX\_SLOW\_LOGS, AUDIT\_LOGS). Empty disables log publishing. | `list(string)` | ```[ "ES_APPLICATION_LOGS", "SEARCH_SLOW_LOGS", "INDEX_SLOW_LOGS" ]``` | no |

Set create = false to skip them: attach indexer\_policy\_json / reader\_policy\_json to existing roles and list them in additional\_principal\_arns. EKS Pod Identity allows one association per ServiceAccount, so a ServiceAccount that already has a role (the sessions worker has the bucket role) needs a separate ServiceAccount for search. | ```object({ create = optional(bool, true) name_prefix = optional(string) path = optional(string, "/") permissions_boundary_arn = optional(string) oidc_provider_arn = optional(string) indexer_service_accounts = optional(list(object({ cluster_name = optional(string) namespace = string service_account = string })), []) reader_service_accounts = optional(list(object({ cluster_name = optional(string) namespace = string service_account = string })), []) })``` | `{}` | no |

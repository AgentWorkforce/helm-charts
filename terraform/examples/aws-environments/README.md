# AWS environments

An environment-aware data stack for self-hosted Agent Relay. It composes RDS
PostgreSQL 17 (or explicitly selected Aurora PostgreSQL), S3, private OpenSearch,
and optionally the sessions-pipeline Lambda/SQS/EventBridge runtime. This is
source preparation for a complete installation: mock tests do **not** prove a
live deployment or application compatibility.

The foundation supplies the private network, EKS, Pod Identity agent, security
groups, administrative runner access, NAT/endpoints, state bucket, KMS grants
and the OpenSearch service-linked role. Foundation and application lifecycle
remain separate from this data state. Foundation automation is tracked in
[helm-charts#59](https://github.com/AgentWorkforce/helm-charts/issues/59).

## Environments and state

Choose any lowercase `environment` slug (up to 16 characters), independently of
its development/staging/production sizing class. The combined
`name_prefix-environment` must fit in 21 characters. Resources, namespace,
verification markers and tags are environment-scoped. Use a unique prefix or
environment name for every installation in the same account/region.

| Class | RDS | Backups | OpenSearch |
|---|---|---|---|
| development | t4g.micro, 20 GiB, single AZ | 7 days | one t3.small node, 20 GiB |
| staging | t4g.medium, 100 GiB, Multi-AZ | 14 days | one node per supplied AZ, m7g.large, 100 GiB |
| production | r7g.large, 100 GiB, Multi-AZ | 35 days | three r7g.large data nodes, dedicated masters, Multi-AZ standby, 200 GiB |

Production refuses database deletion protection being disabled and requires
three distinct search subnets in three AZs. The foundation must verify their
actual AZs; distinct IDs alone cannot establish AZ placement. Aurora requires
an explicit region-supported engine version and compatible instance class;
RDS live proof does not qualify Aurora.

Copy a matching pair from `profiles/` into an approved private directory and
replace every placeholder. Keep the JSON files uncommitted, with mode 0600.
The runner requires encrypted S3 state with native locking and an exact expected
bucket owner. Keys must end in:

```text
/<account_id>/<region>/<environment>/data.tfstate
```

Foundation and application state use different keys. CLI workspaces are not
used: the runner refuses both an environment-selected workspace and a cached
non-default workspace. Credentials belong to the approved runner, never backend
JSON, Terraform variables, values files or command output. State and saved plans
contain operational metadata and must remain private even without passwords.

## Review and apply

From the repository root, under the intended customer's AWS identity:

```sh
python3 terraform/scripts/aws-environment.py plan \
  --variables /approved/private/dev.tfvars.json \
  --backend /approved/private/dev.backend.json
python3 terraform/scripts/aws-environment.py show \
  --variables /approved/private/dev.tfvars.json \
  --backend /approved/private/dev.backend.json
```

Review the saved plan and its account, region, environment, resource inventory,
cost, retention and networking. After approval of that exact plan, run `apply`
with the same arguments and `--approve-plan <saved-plan-SHA-256>`. Receipt v2
binds original variables/backend paths and bytes, Terraform source/dependency
locks, this wrapper, selected tool family and its run-owned CLI configuration.
For local Lambda ZIPs, it also binds the original artifact path/hash and private
content-addressed bytes actually named by the plan's derived variables. Original
input variables and ZIPs are never rewritten. The active `plan-receipt.json`
selects `plans/<random-v4-hex>/data.tfplan` and `variables.json`; local artifacts
live under `artifacts/sha256-<hex>/package.zip`, inside the private run directory.
Review the derived variables and staged artifact lineage with the saved plan.
Legacy receipts are refused: create and review a new v2 plan after upgrading.

The wrapper rechecks original/staged inputs, source, backend, CLI configuration
and receipt around init/plan and immediately before apply. Changed bindings
require a new plan; a refused operation or failed replacement plan preserves the
previous unconsumed approval. Every actual apply attempt atomically moves the
active receipt to that attempt's `apply-attempt-receipt.json` **before** invoking
Terraform, including when apply fails partially. Do not retry it automatically;
retain evidence and independently reconcile exact state/native resources before
reviewing a recovery plan. Receipt renames are atomic for cooperating live
processes, not power-loss durable: directory metadata is not fsynced. After a
host/filesystem crash, independently reconcile backend/state and attempt
evidence before trusting or retrying any recovered approval. This wrapper does
not own automatic rollback or
retirement of a customer's existing installation.

All inherited `TF_*` settings are discarded; the child uses only controlled
input/data-directory/CLI-config settings, with a run-owned configuration that
disables checkpoints. `TF_BIN` selects only the approved `terraform`/`tofu`
family before environment sanitization. These are drift checks, not isolation
from concurrent hostile same-UID or privileged mutation. Use an approved
PATH/toolchain and exclude concurrent privileged mutation. The wrapper does not
attest executable/provider bytes or remote backend state; Terraform's own
saved-plan/state locking checks remain necessary. Provider credentials refresh
through the runner's normal SDK chain; the provider fences the allowed account.

Use `output` with the same arguments to export **only** non-secret verification
references to `terraform/.runs/<account>/<region>/<environment>/verification.json`.
`TF_BIN=tofu` selects OpenTofu; use one reviewed tool/version and dependency lock
for the lifecycle. The committed lock is for Terraform. OpenTofu rewrites
implicit provider registry addresses and uses different package checksums;
initialize and review that tool's converted lock in a separate checkout before
using the runner. A Terraform lock cannot simply be used read-only with
OpenTofu. Normal runner operations require a reviewed, tool-compatible lock and
never upgrade providers implicitly. The runner exposes no destroy command.

### Pippen sandbox execution

Pippen allocates/leases/sweeps AWS accounts; these Terraform files create the
product infrastructure. Reuse the assigned account and certificate identity.
Follow the Pippen owner's current runbook for `sandbox up` and `status`, then set
the returned account/session and agent in `pippen`, and use a prefix such as
`pippen-sbx-ar`. Every product invocation runs under refreshing credentials:

```sh
pippen sandbox exec aws-proof -- \
  python3 terraform/scripts/aws-environment.py plan \
  --variables /approved/private/dev.tfvars.json \
  --backend /approved/private/dev.backend.json
```

Use the same wrapper for show/apply/output. The runner verifies Pippen's exported
account/agent/session and exact STS caller, and refuses a Pippen execution whose
configuration omits the lease instead of silently using customer defaults. Any
`PIPPEN_SANDBOX_*` marker requires the complete exact declared/exported tuple;
a recognized `agent-session` STS caller cannot opt out by stripping markers.
These checks do not allocate an account or grant credentials. Roles use `/pippen/workload/`, the
Pippen boundary, reserved tags and bucket prefix. No fallback to an admin role
is provided. Before live use the Pippen owner must confirm the deployed boundary
and sweeper support RDS, OpenSearch, Lambda/SQS/EventBridge and the foundation
resources. Existing S3-only or mock proof does not establish that support.

The state bucket must outlive inner stack teardown. Preserve approved recovery
data, state and receipts outside any session prefix Pippen will sweep. Never
delete the baseline workspace bucket. End with the owner-run Pippen sweep and a
`clean: true` receipt; investigate quarantine rather than bypassing it. Pippen
currently supplies AWS sandboxes, not GCP project vending.

## Existing runtime identities

By default this root manages the search and Lambda execution roles as before.
For an approved bootstrap phase that owns these identities separately, set:

```hcl
existing_runtime_roles = {
  indexer_role_arn  = "arn:aws:iam::111111111111:role/bootstrap/example-indexer"
  reader_role_arn   = "arn:aws:iam::111111111111:role/bootstrap/example-reader"
  # Required exactly when pipeline_runtime = "lambda"; omit in worker mode.
  pipeline_role_arn = "arn:aws:iam::111111111111:role/bootstrap/example-pipeline"
}
```

Replace the placeholder account and role names. Both search identities are
required together; Lambda mode additionally requires the pipeline identity.
Empty, wildcard, foreign-account, duplicate, administrative and managed-storage
role aliases are refused. The search module's existing `workload_roles.create =
false` path creates neither its roles/inline policies nor Pod Identity
associations. The functions module similarly authors no execution-role IAM.
All supplied runtime principals are included in the private OpenSearch domain
policy alongside its distinct administrator. Fine-grained OpenSearch role
mappings are still required: a domain policy does not make the reader read-only.
`verification.search` exports the supplied effective ARNs; verification and
application service-account names retain their existing contract.

The product bootstrap owner must independently verify the exact role, trust,
policy, boundary and mandatory-guard hashes, and arrange the exact EKS Pod
Identity associations before application use. This state performs no IAM reads
or validation of those properties, and does not grant the caller `iam:PassRole`
or other permissions. `runtime_role_policy_json` exports proposed indexer,
reader and optional pipeline permissions for review, including the Lambda's
OpenSearch indexer grant. It never installs them for external roles; generated
resource references can remain unknown until creation. The separate bootstrap
must resolve the exact resource scope and dependency order before activation.

These are product-owned bootstrap prerequisites, not new product resources in
Pippen's baseline. This option does **not** make the complete data root IAM-free:
the sessions-bucket access role and its worker/alleyoop associations retain their
existing ownership. It also does not provide a closed Pippen capability profile,
change the accepted caller contract, install guard infrastructure or prove any
live deployment. Those remain separate reviewed work. Null retains current
managed-role defaults. For existing deployments, use a reviewed IAM state
ownership handoff before changing modes; otherwise Terraform proposes deleting
the old managed roles/policies/associations. Preserve external identities through
consumer retirement and remove them in their owning bootstrap phase afterwards.

## Lambda provider and PostgreSQL TLS bindings

The private managed-OpenSearch Lambda artifact needs explicit non-secret runtime
configuration in addition to its immutable ZIP/image reference. Set
`lambda_runtime_bindings` using the Lambda profile example. The index must start
with `<name_prefix>-<environment>-` and match the artifact's lowercase letter/digit/
underscore/hyphen grammar (maximum 201 characters, no dots). Choose a fresh reviewed index for a changed
search representation. `state_backend_id` is the shared writer/reader base ID
(maximum 114 identifier characters); the matching artifact appends
`.js-literal-v2` before using its 128-character PostgreSQL completeness key.
`complete_since` must be `epoch` or a nonnegative RFC3339 timestamp.

The root passes the managed domain endpoint and region, index, projection schema,
completeness settings, and strict PostgreSQL TLS configuration to the function.
The matching artifact must contain the reviewed public CA at
`assets/postgres-ca.pem`; `postgres_ca_sha256` must equal the digest of those exact
packaged bytes. The configured runtime path is `/var/task/assets/postgres-ca.pem`.
Terraform does not inspect a remote ZIP/image, fetch a CA, mount a file or prove
that the chosen artifact implements this contract. Lambda supplies its reserved
`AWS_REGION` variable; this root does not override it.

`lambda_shared_environment` exports the same non-secret configuration for the
matching reader deployment. Independently verify that reader's immutable
artifact, read-only database identity, JWT issuer/audience/JWKS/origin, and
schema/FGAC bootstrap. Keep passwords, database URLs and AWS credentials in the
existing reviewed secret/runtime identity path, outside these bindings.

Omitting bindings preserves inactive provisioning behavior, and worker mode
rejects Lambda-only bindings. Automatic Lambda activation now refuses missing
bindings. Supplying them is configuration only: the existing exact-artifact,
managed-RDS bootstrap, projection-state grants, OpenSearch schema/role mappings,
S3/SQS event-path, private networking and overlapping-worker retirement checks
must still pass before an operator sets `activate_lambda = true`. No runtime
invocation creates schema or grants, and this change performs no activation.

## Lambda bootstrap and the complete application

Worker mode is the default. Lambda mode requires `pipeline_runtime = "lambda"`,
private function security groups, and exactly one compatible immutable package:
a digest-pinned ECR Lambda image, a **versioned** S3 ZIP (not the mutable `null`
version), or a local ZIP with its base64 SHA-256. [`profiles/lambda.tfvars.json.example`](profiles/lambda.tfvars.json.example)
shows an additive fragment to merge into an environment file. The Lambda module
uses Node 24/arm64 for ZIPs; a Bun services image is not a Lambda handler package.

`activate_lambda` defaults to false, disabling the queue event source mapping
and both schedules. The queue and bucket notification still exist and can
accumulate messages. Direct authorized invocation remains possible. Before a
separate reviewed activation plan:

1. Verify package provenance, handler/schema assets, TLS support and actual
   provider adapter dispatch in the deployed pipeline **and** read API.
2. Complete a managed-RDS-compatible HoopDb bootstrap, with distinct owner and
   runtime credentials, extension/ACL convergence and generation checks. The
   existing true-superuser CNPG bootstrap is not an RDS bootstrap. Lambda cannot
   reach a Kubernetes-only CNPG Service merely by sharing a VPC.
3. Populate the pipeline's empty secret out of band, using runtime credentials.
   Never use the RDS master account as an application credential.
4. Configure OpenSearch fine-grained permissions for distinct indexer, Lambda
   writer and reader roles. The temporary proof mappings below are not the
   application's permanent security configuration.
5. Disable overlapping reconcile/referee/cost-sweep worker stages, account for
   queued messages, and verify no second pipeline owner will run. Lambda is an
   alternative for those stages; the remaining application workers still run.

The `application_contract` output records the required full suite:
relaycontrol API, relay-dashboard, sessions-pipeline, relayhistory, Relaycast
backed by first-party Terse/durable-actors, RelayAuth, and optional Relayfile.
It is not a deployable Helm overlay. Actor placement/runtime identities, actor
storage buckets, component databases and Secrets, Redis where required,
DNS/TLS, authentication and application wiring still belong in the reviewed
foundation/application installation. ServiceAccount outputs must match actual
chart component identities; creating Pod Identity associations alone grants no
running workload the intended binding.

## Live verification

Use an approved private Linux/macOS runner with refreshed AWS credentials, network access,
`boto3` and `psycopg[binary]`. The verifier reads Secrets Manager only in memory
for PostgreSQL and prints bounded receipts without URLs or secret values.
Choose one random run ID (`python3 -c 'import uuid; print(uuid.uuid4().hex)'`) and
use it for every phase:

```sh
python3 terraform/scripts/verify-aws-data.py configuration \
  --config /approved/private/verification.json --run-id <32-hex-run-id> \
  --confirm-account <account> --confirm-region us-west-2 \
  --confirm-environment dev --confirm-environment-class development \
  --confirm-name-prefix agent-relay \
  --confirm-search-url <separately-reviewed-private-HTTPS-search-url> --confirm-live
```

The account, region, environment, class, installation prefix and exact private
OpenSearch HTTPS URL must come from
an independently reviewed installation/backend record, not from the target JSON
being verified. Confirm the exact URL against a separately reviewed native
DescribeDomain record and expected domain ARN: domain names can repeat across
accounts, and the opaque endpoint suffix is not an account ownership proof.
Do not automatically derive `--confirm-search-url` from the untrusted target
JSON. All confirmations are required, including for cleanup. Replacing
`verification.json` with another installation's otherwise valid same-account,
same-environment output is refused before constructing an SDK session. There is
no permissive legacy schema fallback: regenerate `verification` after upgrading.
For Pippen, also supply the exact independently reviewed
`--confirm-pippen-agent <agent> --confirm-pippen-session <UUID>`; both must match
the exported tuple. Customer mode refuses exported/native Pippen ownership tags.

The closed output includes `name_prefix`, `environment_class`, nullable `pippen`,
`postgres.identifier`/`master_username`, and `pipeline.function_name`. Every phase
and the direct-import helpers require an immutable `ConfirmedInstallation` of
scalar values (including that exact independently confirmed HTTPS origin),
validate all derived resource names and unqualified ARN types,
and check the caller before a target operation. RDS uses
`<prefix>-<environment>-pg` (instance or Aurora cluster); Lambda uses
`<prefix>-<environment>-session-pipeline`; bucket/search names and writer
endpoints follow this root's exact conventions. Import callers must construct
that confirmation separately with `confirm_installation(...)`; omitting it is an
error. Before signing each direct `Search.call`, its path and exact confirmed
origin are checked first, then STS must report the confirmed account and a
well-formed same-account ARN. A recognized common `agent-session` caller must
match the selected Pippen lease and is refused in customer mode. Runtime-role
callers remain supported. Direct `Search` checks account/common lease; the
phase helpers additionally enforce their exact configured phase-role ARN.
Neither check inspects native IAM role content or establishes authorization.
Names and confirmations are safety checks, not IAM authorization.

Before `GetSecretValue`, the PostgreSQL phase checks singleton native RDS/Aurora
metadata, PostgreSQL17 engine/status, exact identifiers/ARNs, private/encrypted
settings, database/port/master username, backups/protection, writer endpoint and
active managed-secret linkage. Aurora also checks every unique member's exact
installation name/ARN, cluster membership, private settings and tags. Native
`Environment`, `EnvironmentClass`, `ManagedBy` and, when selected, all three exact
Pippen ownership tags must match before reading credentials. Missing, duplicate,
malformed, foreign or denied metadata refuses the operation. These tags come
from the existing DescribeDBInstances/DescribeDBClusters responses; no new IAM
grant or permission fallback is installed. The returned secret ARN and master
username are checked again before SQL; secret values remain only in memory.

Before `Invoke`, Lambda native name/unqualified ARN, execution-role ARN,
`Environment`/`EnvironmentClass`/`ManagedBy`/optional Pippen tags, arm64/private-VPC
state and reviewed code/image must match. Missing or denied tags refuse; a
`GetFunction` response with tag errors is not accepted. The external-role seam
remains: equality to the reviewed output role proves only the actual function's
binding. Independently verify that role's native ownership, trust, boundary,
inline/attached policy content and approved installation use; this helper does
not inspect IAM role content or make an authorization claim from its ARN. No
new permission grants are added to make a refused read succeed.

Run `postgres` with `--rds-ca /approved/rds-global-bundle.pem` to require real
PostgreSQL 17, private RDS metadata, encryption/backups/protection and
`sslmode=verify-full`, then a temporary-table round trip. Run `storage` under the
storage role for synthetic put/get/list/delete. Every configuration and storage
S3 request binds `ExpectedBucketOwner` to the separately confirmed account,
including cleanup; a name containing an account ID is not ownership proof.
Version history is retained.

Run `search-bootstrap` as the separate administrator, `search-write` as the
indexer, `search-read` as the reader, then `search-cleanup` as the administrator,
each with the same arguments and run ID. Each phase first requires the independently confirmed exact search URL, so
runtime roles need no new DescribeDomain permission. Native bootstrap still
checks domain ARN and endpoint linkage. These phases create temporary scoped
FGAC roles/mappings and two synthetic indices, verify the marker, reject both
single and bulk reader writes, reject access to a known foreign index, and
check the rejected writes had no effects before cleanup. Signed requests never
follow redirects. Direct `Search.call` paths must have exactly one leading
slash, remain on the confirmed HTTPS origin, and contain no backslash, control
character or fragment; refusal precedes credential access or signing. Keep cleanup failures visible and retain the run ID so the
exact synthetic resources can be retired later.

`lambda-smoke` checks the deployed arm64/private-VPC artifact and explicitly
invokes reconcile. ZIPs also need the reviewed `--lambda-code-sha256`. An invoke
HTTP 200 with `FunctionError` fails. This proves initialization/reconcile only;
the complete proof must additionally upload a synthetic session through the
real courier, follow S3 notification -> SQS -> Lambda -> RDS/OpenSearch -> read
API, and verify tenant/lease isolation, partial failures, DLQ/replay,
idempotence, all required application components, optional Relayfile on/off,
backup/restore, upgrade and clean retirement. Resource creation and a successful
smoke invocation are not full application proof.

Do not tear down an existing environment until ownership and a current
consistent recovery set are recorded. RDS deletion protection, final snapshots,
versioned non-empty S3 and the search module's `prevent_destroy` intentionally
block casual destruction. Any retirement needs a reviewed protection change,
exact destroy inventory and recovery proof; do not remove state to bypass them.

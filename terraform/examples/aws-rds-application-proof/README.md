# Held actual-RDS application SQL fixture

This independent source fixture composes the actual AWS PostgreSQL/object-storage
modules for a new disposable PostgreSQL17 instance, explicit snapshot/restore
clone, versioned S3 bucket, empty runtime Secrets Manager container and temporary
ARM host. It runs the unchanged reviewed HoopDB bootstrap/migrator/readiness library
from Sessions composition `292359f0c68b1e4615704fd51d303b7f6b4db445`.

A completed live run proves only those selected SQL/readiness/module storage checks.
Source mocks/imports and synthetic client tests do not prove actual RDS behavior,
projection state, OpenSearch/FGAC/provider conformance, Lambda or the full suite.
There is no untrusted-code, tenant-isolation, production durability or HA claim.
Actual execution remains held for complete TF/host/payload/private parent-driver
review and separate exact saved-plan admission. No platform grant, account/project,
existing app/role, parent DNS, publication or deployment change is made here.

## Ownership and external prerequisites

Use fresh isolated state and a unique run in an existing reviewed account/region/
VPC. Select existing private AZ subnets or two bounded owned local-only subnets;
existing routes are untouched. Public host subnet/IGW route, DNS, NACL/private
connectivity, exact AL2023 ARM64 AMI, PostgreSQL17 minor and current permission
intersection are native prerequisites. Existing RDS service-linked role and regional AWS-managed service
keys (aws/rds, aws/secretsmanager, aws/s3) are external baseline prerequisites,
not authored/imported/deleted here; parent preflight must establish them before
claiming all new fixture resources can retire. Missing permission is reported, never
bypassed or widened. The host has no ingress/key, encrypted delete-on-termination
root disk, IMDSv2/hop1, bounded containers, terminate-on-shutdown and a two-hour OS
timer. Parent owns the hard deadline/finally; self-shutdown is not cleanup evidence.

New `/pippen/workload/` verifier role and `eks*` profile retain the existing boundary.
GetSecretValue names only the new master/runtime ARNs; PutSecretValue names only
the runtime ARN, with explicit other-resource Deny. Every workload Allow expires
at the immutable input deadline. The parent must validate that deadline against
current time/original lease and budget the whole lifecycle. HCL format checks do
not independently prove lease/human authority; do not extend a failed fixture.
S3 grants cover exact-version source/seed reads, fixed receipt/pending keys and
owned synthetic prefix. Specialized search/Lambda permissions are not used.

Terraform owns only an initially empty runtime secret container. Secret values/
versions never enter Terraform variables/state/data/output/user-data. The container
uses AWS-managed encryption and explicit zero-recovery retirement because every
credential is new and disposable. The RDS-managed master secret remains separate;
no production secret is derived, overwritten or re-used.

## Immutable source preparation

Use an own T7 Sessions worktree at exact292359, real Bun1.4.2 frozen installation
and its original bun.lock. The requested npm-ci attempt refuses this Bun-only
project's absent npm lock; never invent a lock or link another checkout's modules.
All11RDS+23portable owner inputs are byte-checked. Original TypeScript paths,
import.meta.url, actual SQL/verifier/JSON assets and pg8.23.1's exact lock closure
are copied and hashed. A closed hook resolves only the vendor scrub alias from
shared/log.ts. The separate `rds-profile-proof.ts` emulation harness is never
packaged, imported or executed.

Commit Helm source/provider lock first, then build twice with fresh T7 outputs:

```sh
node proof/build-payload.mjs --source /T7/clean-guest-source \
  --output /T7/new-payload-a --ca /T7/reviewed-public-rds-ca.pem \
  --ca-sha256 REVIEWED_CA_SHA256 --wrong-ca proof/assets/wrong-ca.pem
```

Use Node24. Public CA bytes/digest are reviewed explicitly and archived; runtime
never fetches them. The wrong-CA public asset is synthetic and its disposable
creation key was removed; it is never production trust. Builder binds clean Helm
commit/tree/source/provider lock, original guest manifest/generation/Bun lock/all
transitive bytes, pinned Node/psql images and CA. Dirty test builds require a flag
and are marked/rejected for operations. Repeat archive SHA must match. Parent
separately binds selected provider binaries/backend/state/plan/runner and real S3
VersionIds. Source/build commands call no cloud/database APIs or image publisher.

`extract_payload.py` bounds compressed/uncompressed/member sizes, verifies exact
hash/source/lock/CA/inventory before any unpacked execution, and refuses traversal,
duplicates, links, unlisted/test-only/source-only artifacts or emulation bytes.
Host rechecks installed files before secret retrieval. Image VOLUME paths become
bounded tmpfs; any actual volume mount refuses; finally uses rm --volumes. Public
source streams over stdin without host bind mounts/socket/host networking. No
explicit AWS credential values cross guest pipes; same-host trusted code is NOT an
AWS-authority sandbox. Stripped environment/IMDS settings do not prove isolation.

## SQL, password and restore ordering

Host verifies fresh owned-role STS, exact available/private/encrypted/protected
RDS17 ARN/tags/endpoint/VPC and native managed-master mapping. Owner credential is
RAM-only; seed records VersionId, restore retrieves that exact historical version.
Scope/source hashes are expected-response provenance, not independent AWS identity.

The original guest uses explicit pg hostname/CA verification and bounded IO.
Bootstrap admits only six committed path/hash/nonsecret-variable tuples. Detached
psql17 uses -X/-W/ON_ERROR_STOP/-f with owner password through anonymous stdin.
Runtime callbacks generate random initial/rotated values and use client-encrypted
`\password` stdin prompts. No password/SCRAM material enters argv/environment/files,
raw output logs, Runner command files, cloud-init/journal or foreign error text.
The process helper bounds RAM/time, settles owned groups and returns typed errors.
It is not a general remote executor, client approval file or secure-erasure claim.

Original bootstrap/migration/idempotency/runtime readiness and connection closure
must finish before publication. Prior runtime passwords must fail FRESH login
with exact28P01 after rotation; a surviving session, DNS/TLS/timeout/denial is not
password refusal. Wrong CA/hostname must cause real certificate validation errors.
pg overwrites ssl.servername with its DNS host; local negative therefore uses an
alternate DNS alias to the same server, and operational negative invokes Node's
default certificate checker with a deliberately wrong expected hostname.

Only after full original guest success does host PutSecretValue use the exact new
ARN and pending-recorded UUID, with secret JSON through stdin. Returned ARN/VersionId
must match; exact-version Get readback matches RAM bytes, then persisted-password
fresh TLS/readiness precedes success. Parent receives only nonsecret references,
checks and content-free catalog hashes.

Restore pins seed receipt version/hash, historical master/runtime VersionIds and
catalog digest. It authenticates using the exact SEED runtime version and proves
TLS/readiness BEFORE any bootstrap/password mutation; host protocol requires the
acknowledgement. Unchanged restored guest then proves both old-password28P01 cases,
new readiness and unchanged catalog digest, and stores a distinct final version.
Seed version/label stays immutable; AWSCURRENT or password derivation is no substitute.

## Parent lifecycle and complete retirement

Parent owns the separately reviewed private saved-plan/state/history driver; this
source does not implement a duplicate framework. Required admission binds source,
vars, saved plan, provider lock/binaries, backend/current state/runner and fresh
exact Pippen caller for each phase. Provision without compute, verify native empty
secret/policy/network prerequisites, upload immutable payload version, then review
host launch. Exact successful seed receipt admits the Terraform marker snapshot/
restore. Application catalog digest is `guest.receipt.evidenceSha256`, with master
`secret_version_id` and `runtime_secret_version_id`; SELECT1/module marker is insufficient.

Before each SQL/secret write, host saves a nonsecret intent with a real VersionId
at `receipts/{seed|restore}.pending.json`; publication UUID identifies a possible
SM version. Duplicate/timeout/partial SQL/ambiguous publication quarantines, never
silently resumes/rotates/replaces a passing checkpoint. Unsettled group exits75 and
forbids further AWS calls. Parent preserves pending/raw candidates and reconciles
exact owned resources. No grant repair or fixed-role drops on retained instances.

Parent persists pending BEFORE every apply; candidate/state/native IDs and cumulative
compute history survive BEFORE validation. Failed state read/empty JSON after an
attempted apply never means no resources. Uncaptured partial apply, stale capture,
unknown inventory, unsettled processes or expired authority requires exact-owned
recovery; no ordinary automatic cleanup/fallback identity is inferred.

After stopping all owned hosts, metadata-only all-page capture produces
`runtime_secret_inventory={arn,version_ids,complete:true}`, including0 before
publication. No value GET for cleanup. `compute_inventory={complete:true,instance_ids}`
exactly matches unique lifetime compute_history (max2); zero is valid after captured
PROVISION iff contract.compute is null, otherwise last history equals current
contract.compute. Missing/truncated/foreign/duplicate inventory refuses before IO.

Separately review protection-release changes affecting only deletion_protection,
then exact-owned delete-only Terraform plan/state. No state-rm, old-resource import,
protection bypass or native deletion of unknown DBs. Retire primary/clone, explicit
snapshot, retained primary automated backups by exact DbiResourceId, runtime container/
ALLversions, managed master secret, cumulative compute/rootvolume/ENI/LT/SG/role/profile
and owned subnet/route/association IDs. Final snapshots are skipped deliberately;
explicit marker snapshot is tracked. Fixed SQL roles retire with whole instances.

S3 drainer admits the exact complete key/version/MPU ledger, including pending
receipt versions, refuses unknown/unrelated inventory BEFORE deletion and retains
the pinned sentinel until Terraform removes its own object. Preserve evidence
externally before bucket deletion. Secret deletion is asynchronous: success or
DeletionDate is not absence. Typed DescribeSecret AND ListSecretVersionIds NotFound
prove exact container/all versions gone. Denied, untyped empty responses, refresh
failure and recovery schedules never count. State0 plus independent specific native
absence closes the fixture; existing VPC/routes/apps/resources remain outside scope.

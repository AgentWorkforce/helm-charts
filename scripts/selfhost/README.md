# Agent Relay self-host safety checks

`verify-agent-relay.sh` performs a read-only, non-secret smoke check of an
installed agent-relay Helm suite. It exits nonzero if it cannot prove the
required release, migration, workload, ingress, health, or certificate state.

`pre-upgrade-check.sh` is a separate read-only gate for upgrades. It requires
evidence of a current backup, a successful isolated restore drill, and an
explicit migration-compatibility review that matches the deployed Helm
revision. It also refuses to pass while a selected migration or backup Job is
active or failed.

## Safety properties

Both scripts:

- runs only read operations (`helm status` and `kubectl get`/`api-resources`);
- never requests Kubernetes `Secret` resources;
- never requests pod logs, rendered manifests, Helm values, or response bodies;
- never prints raw command output, ingress certificate references, certificate
  contents, health URLs, or error responses;
- does not run `apply`, `patch`, `delete`, `rollout restart`, Helm upgrade, or
  any other deployment mutation.

It reads cert-manager `Certificate` status when that API is available. A
`Certificate` can reference a Secret in its spec, but the referenced Secret is
not fetched and its name is not printed.

Neither script proves that a database migration is reversible. Helm rollback
changes Kubernetes release resources; it does not reverse database schema or
data changes.

## Requirements

- Bash 4 or newer
- `helm`
- `kubectl`
- `python3`
- `curl`
- `openssl`
- GNU `timeout`
- network access to the Kubernetes API and public ingress endpoints
- read access to Deployments, StatefulSets, DaemonSets, Jobs, Pods, Ingresses,
  and, when installed, cert-manager Certificates

## Pre-upgrade gate

Create three non-secret JSON evidence files. The backup must represent the
currently deployed release revision and a recovery set captured while writes
were quiesced:

```json
{
  "recoveryId": "ar-20261102T180000Z",
  "status": "PASS",
  "providerStatus": "SUCCESSFUL",
  "sourceRelease": "agent-relay",
  "sourceRevision": 7,
  "writesQuiesced": true,
  "artifactsComplete": true,
  "completedAt": "2026-11-02T18:10:00Z"
}
```

The restore evidence must identify the same recovery set and a completed
isolated restore:

```json
{
  "recoveryId": "ar-20261102T180000Z",
  "status": "PASS",
  "isolated": true,
  "allVerificationGatesPassed": true,
  "completedAt": "2026-11-02T19:00:00Z"
}
```

The compatibility evidence must name the source revision and reviewed target.
`databaseMigration` is either `backward-compatible` or `forward-only`.
`rollbackStrategy` must be `database-restore` or `side-by-side-restore`;
`helm-rollback` is deliberately not accepted because it cannot undo database
migrations.

```json
{
  "status": "PASS",
  "sourceRevision": 7,
  "targetChartVersion": "0.1.0",
  "databaseMigration": "forward-only",
  "rollbackStrategy": "side-by-side-restore",
  "reviewedAt": "2026-11-02T19:15:00Z"
}
```

Run the gate immediately before the reviewed `helm upgrade`:

```bash
scripts/selfhost/pre-upgrade-check.sh \
  --context my-gcp-context \
  --namespace agent-relay \
  --release agent-relay \
  --target-chart charts/agent-relay \
  --backup-evidence ./evidence/backup.json \
  --restore-evidence ./evidence/restore.json \
  --compatibility-evidence ./evidence/compatibility.json
```

The default maximum ages are 24 hours for backup evidence, 720 hours for a
restore drill, and 168 hours for compatibility review. Tighten them to match
policy. The reviewed `targetChartVersion` must match `helm show chart` for
`--target-chart`. A passing result is a gate, not permission to mutate the
cluster and not a promise that automatic rollback is safe.

## Post-install and post-upgrade verification

### Basic use

```bash
./verify-agent-relay.sh \
  --context my-gcp-context \
  --namespace agent-relay \
  --release agent-relay
```

The default suite selector is:

```text
app.kubernetes.io/instance=<release>
```

Override it when the chart uses another release label:

```bash
./verify-agent-relay.sh \
  --namespace agent-relay \
  --release agent-relay \
  --selector 'app.kubernetes.io/part-of=agent-relay'
```

Run `./verify-agent-relay.sh --help` for all options.

### What is proved

1. **Release:** `helm status --output json` reports `deployed`.
2. **Migrations:** matching Kubernetes Jobs have `Complete=True`, no failed
   attempts, and no incomplete Jobs.
3. **Workloads:** release Deployments, StatefulSets, and DaemonSets have
   observed their current generation and have all desired replicas ready and
   updated.
4. **Pods:** selected Pods are running with every regular container ready, or
   have successfully completed.
5. **Ingress:** matching Ingresses exist, expose rule hosts, and have admitted
   load-balancer addresses.
6. **Health:** every explicit or derived endpoint returns an HTTP 2xx response.
   The response body is discarded.
7. **Certificate:** each selected TLS ingress host completes a trusted TLS
   handshake, matches its hostname, and remains valid for the configured
   minimum period. cert-manager `Certificate` readiness is also checked when
   available.

Migration Job completion proves only that the selected Job completed. It does
not prove application-version compatibility, downgrade compatibility, or
migration reversibility; those are pre-upgrade review inputs.

By default, health URLs are derived as:

```text
https://<ingress-rule-host>/health
```

For charts with another health route, set `--health-path`:

```bash
./verify-agent-relay.sh \
  --namespace agent-relay \
  --release agent-relay \
  --health-path /healthz
```

Or supply one or more exact endpoints:

```bash
./verify-agent-relay.sh \
  --namespace agent-relay \
  --release agent-relay \
  --health-url https://relay.example.com/health \
  --health-url https://api.example.com/healthz
```

Health URLs containing user information, passwords, query strings, or fragments
are rejected. URL paths and hosts are not included in proof output. Do not put
tokens or other secrets in a health URL path.

### Migration selection

Without an override, Jobs are first selected by the suite selector, then
identified as migrations when their name or common component labels contain
`migration`, `schema`, `database-setup`, or `db-setup`.

If the chart uses another convention, select its migration Jobs explicitly:

```bash
./verify-agent-relay.sh \
  --namespace agent-relay \
  --release agent-relay \
  --migration-selector 'app.kubernetes.io/component=database-migration'
```

The verifier is evidence-oriented: no discoverable migration Job is a failure.
Use `--allow-missing-migrations` only when successful Jobs are intentionally
deleted and migration proof is provided elsewhere.

### Intentional exceptions

Strict checks can be relaxed for known deployment shapes:

- `--allow-missing-migrations`
- `--allow-missing-workloads`
- `--allow-missing-ingress`
- `--allow-no-tls`

Each accepted exception produces a `PROOF|SKIP|...` record, so omitted evidence
is visible rather than silently treated as success.

### Proof output and exit status

Output is line-oriented and suitable for CI logs:

```text
PROOF|PASS|release|status=deployed
PROOF|PASS|migrations|jobs=1 complete=1
PROOF|PASS|workloads|controllers=4 ready=4
PROOF_RESULT=PASS
PROOF_COUNTS pass=10 fail=0 skip=1
```

The final result is `PASS` only when there are no failed checks. Exit code `0`
means `PASS`, `1` means one or more checks failed, and `2` means invalid usage.

## Syntax checks

Run:

```bash
bash -n pre-upgrade-check.sh
bash -n verify-agent-relay.sh
```

If ShellCheck is installed:

```bash
shellcheck pre-upgrade-check.sh
shellcheck verify-agent-relay.sh
```
